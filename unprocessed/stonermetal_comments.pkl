p159
aVOh The Sword - you're so good on record and lack any charisma or stage presence for a good live show.  
p160
aVBullshit. Seen them live twice, and they're great. The singer doesn't dance around and shit, no, but he lets the music speak for itself. And it speaks volumes live.
p161
aVmy buddy said they sounded like a crap judas priest cover band live. they're awesome recorded\u000a
p162
aVThats crazy talk as i've seen them live and they sounded better than the album. 
p163
aVThey sound as good as the venue they're playing allows but the solos are always the same as on the record and the guys just stand in place playing your favorite songs.  No flair, nothing I cant get from buying a live CD.  \u000a\u000aI go to shows to see performers, not guys playing my favorite songs.  It's also nice to be surprised by a reworked song or solo. 
p164
aVWhy the fuck would you go to a show and expect improvisation? Go to a guitar clinic then you dumbass. 
p165
aVDoesnt need to be improvisation but most bands get bored playing the same solos and arrangements they recorded years ago and start to change it up a bit.  Not with the Sword and it's something I see meaning they're great at writing songs but not creative enough to improve on them .  Contrast this with a band like Deerhunter who I've seen 5+ times over the last 6 years, they have a few songs that are completely different each time you hear them and thats even just tour to tour, some of the songs are a good bit away from how they were originally recorded on the album.  \u000a\u000aThey play songs the exact same way they're recorded and thats awesome but I like to see a band do more than that.  Anybody can practice a song enough to play it perfectly live, a true artist can improve on the song in a live situation.\u000a\u000aOr in keeping with a metal band similar to the Sword, the Truckfighters rock live.  The solos are all different than on the album and most of the songs are reworked and improved.  Majestic is drawn out to be a 20+ minute epic journey other songs are just restructured to allow a solo or more crowd interaction.
p166
aVMost metal bands are not jam bands. 
p167
aVThey dont need to be jam bands to change around their tunes over time.  Baroness and Mastodon have done this to a large degree when playing older songs nowadays, they change things up to keep songs fresh.  Zoroaster is another great example of a band that likes to rework their live songs, sometimes to the point of barely recognizing them but still adding to the live show.  \u000a\u000aHere's a great example:\u000a[Zoroaster - Spirit Molecule from their album Voice of Saturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xaZy96h9i8)\u000a\u000a[Zoroaster - Spirit Molecule Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPpTpJMvY_o)\u000a\u000aNot too different but obviously changed up enough to where they're seeing the song as something living and dynamic that can be improved upon or played with.  \u000a\u000aIt's just dull to play the same solo you recorded on a record for the next five years.  Punk bands change things up, indie bands change things up, most metal bands stay the same.

VI don't mean to be a genre elitist here, but your neither your bandcamp nor your kickstarter mention "stoner" anything anywhere. The only reason you're using it here is as an excuse to post another link to your kickstarter. \u000a\u000aBoo spam.
p177
aVWait, isn't it kinda obvious that "stoner" is a bullshit adjective/genre and we're all just interested in plodding, heavy, rocking music?\u000a\u000aSo yes boo spam but it's stoned so it's cool.
p178
aVas i agree with you i side more with the fact that we are stoner metal and my guitarist says we are melodic metal and our drummer thinks we are like older punk. so we try not to specificly define ourselves but since im off this way promoting myself ive put it in all the areas we think we are. if you doubt what i think listen to  these songs in particular on there\u000a(euphoria)\u000aornament blue\u000aa silent word\u000a(murder sessions singles)\u000adark and damaged\u000a(recurring incident)\u000aloaded mile

aVThey're finally back in a groove.  It was a rough few years when they were touring as a three piece.  Their songs are just so thickly orchestrated that you really need two guitars to fill it all in.

p640
aVI seen em three times.  I was a huge fan of Remission and first saw them when they toured for that.  They were fuckin insane.  It was so heavy and Brann was a monster.   Nowadays, obviously, they've cooled it down a bit and tend to be more rockin.  It's a more chill show, but still pretty amazing.  Brann is still a monster.
p641
aVTHey are good live, got a chance to hang with them recently on their tour with gojira &amp; kvelertak. Definitely worth seeing, but at a festival you're going to get a shorter set and the sound quality isn't going to be that great more than likely. If you can afford it go for it, but if you can hold out for another show when they are there by themselves, I guarantee it would be more enjoyable
p642
aVI've seen them twice and had a blast both times.\u000a\u000aFirst time around one of them had a broken leg, and they still had tons of energy.
p643
aVI've seen em twice and they were great for both, the first show especially since it was the crack the Skye tour and they played the album in it's entirety
p644
aVIt depends on the day honestly. I've seen them close to 10 times and sometimes they put on an amazing show and sometimes they are pretty bad. Last time I saw them was in May and they were great. The time before that they sounded awful. It depends on how fucked up Brent is. Also they aren't that good at pulling the newer vocal style off live.
p645
aVI've seen them twice, both in small venues.  The first was the opening date of the Crack the Skye tour and it was incredible.   On the last tour for Once more round the Sun the sound was y muddled IMHO....Brents guitars wear lost in the mix.....IDK man,  I love seeing live shows but I'm more down with small venues.  (Old metal guy)
p646
aVI've seen them twice. First time is still one of the best shows I've ever seen. They were the headliners. \u000aSecond time I saw them it was crap. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and blaming the venue sound for how terrible it was. 
p647
aV3 times.  twice great, once with so so vocals, but the riffs always seem spot on and are awesome to watch them play.  Brann is a beast as well.  Ive only seen them in small venues.  I dont enjoy festivals, I want the band right in my face.
p648
aVI've seen them twice (at festivals), once in Canada and once in Australia. Loved it both times, I thought they were great! Would love to have been able to afford to see them at a sideshow to see how their performance compared.
p649
aVI think their vocals used to suck live, but they have really stepped up their game over the past  few years. They are very tight and on point live.
p650
aVI saw them twice during the Crack The Skye tour and both times were amazing.\u000a\u000aThe first they toured with 3 other bands and didn't play but a few "hits" after they did the entire CtS album. But it was still amazing.\u000a\u000aThe second time it was in a smaller venue it was just them and an opener. I was a few people from the stage and it was one of the best smaller venue shows I've ever been too. So loud. So good.
p651
aVI WOULD GO STRICTLY FOR MOLOTOV! They are an awesomely fun band, and if you like them you will definitely loves them live cause they are pretty wild. Mastodon is cool and all, but Moltov is out of control.
p652
aVChingo yo, changas tu... CHINGA TU MADRE!
p653
aVI think they're pretty phenomenal live, as people have said Brent can sometimes be a bit fucked and though he never seems to miss a note on the guitar his vocals are the teller. I'm impressed that Brann can play those fills whilst singing at all, but sometimes his voice is a tiny bit off too. With a back catalogue like theirs though you're going always in for a rad time. 
p654
aVFrom all of the friends I had in Florida who ever saw them live... They wouldn't shut about their shows.
p655
aVSeen them 3 times, twice were small venues and they sounded great. The other one was outdoor and the sound wasnt as good but still pretty great live, guess it just depends on how bad you want to see them. Im kinda jealous on Apocalyptica though, would love to see them
p656
aVI've seen them 5 times in the Denver area. Each one has been a progressively bigger show both in venue size and audience size. As is obvious on their albums, this band is full of talent and it carries over to their live shows; however, each show I've seen the sound has gotten progressively worse. My favorite show I saw of them was in a small theater in Boulder. They played Crack the Skye in its entirety and it was crisp and clean. It sounded much like the album, but with the added energy of a live show. The subsequent shows just seem to have gotten louder without a care for the mix and the music from the audience's perspective. This is unfortunate. There is so much technical musicianship going on in Mastodon's brand of progressive metal. It's a shame when you know they are up there playing it, but you can't really make it out because the sound is so bad. This has been consistent across three different venues. That being said, there is no arguing they are a great band. I just wish they had better sound at their shows.

p711
aVHmm...no one seems to have posted as yet.  I'm no expert but in my experience any old pair of disposable earplugs are better than nothing though they cut out some of the lower end bass. There are more expensive reusable ones that you can get at music shops that my flatmate swears by. \u000a\u000ahttp://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun05/articles/qa0605_2.htm\u000a\u000aThis article suggests that simple 'musicians' earplugs are good although there is the option for better but more expensive moulded ones from an audiologist. \u000a

aVThe ringing will go away after a day, invest in some good musicians earplugs

(lp876
V[There Can Only Be One.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dZFH2M_9VY)
p877
aVThat's such a good tune. The first time I ever heard it I was baked and i listened to the whole thing just staring at the wall. It brought me to total euphoria. The same thing happened with Bongrippers "Worship".

aVlove Bongripper

aVnice!
p883
aVOr any other Elder! I personally prefer White Walls and Ghost Head. Still want to take a hit of that cosmic blunt...
p884
aVnot stoner metal but [maggotbrain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3bleXWaCk) is the shit when youre baked
p885
aVElectric Wizard's "Dopethrone."\u000a[And it's not stoner metal, but the Beatles' White Album is fucking awesome stoned.]
p886
aVCould not agree more. The intro to Funeralopolis is also ridiculous when you're baked.
p887
aVi like to listen to dopethrone into funeralopolis into we hate you.... it's a great progression if you only have time for a few songs and not the entire album.

p893
aVman, the body is legit terrifying. most insane guitar tone.
p894
aVsince i've started listening to these guys I always try weird stuff with pedals and eq to try and figure out some crazy tone of my own. nothing nearly as cool as them has come up haha
p895
aVtubes and lots of volume and hellish downtuning is basically their trick...i think theres nothing more important in determining your own sound than lots of tubes, volume and feeling...i see way too many people playing on solid state combo amps these days and wondering why theres no sense of space in their sound. these guys always sound fucking *glacial* to me.
p896
aVI play out of a triple rectifier that I scored on craigslist with a matching 4x12 cab. Sounds huge and beautiful and is full of tubes and I play in B standard (BEADF#B). The dude uses some sort of (probably tube?) Peavey combo amp running into one of the beastier Sunn solid state bass heads, and that goes into some EQ rack thing, and all that runs into a mountain of cabs. He has a couple pedals though, gotta know what they are!!!
p897
aVNice! I had no clue what his setup was like...sounds mammoth.  What always blows me away is the relative lack of distortion they use. It always sounds like pure weight to me.
p898
aVtotally. pure sonic blasting
p899
aVI agree with Holy Mountain, but it's all good.. Recently there's 2 albums I've been enjoying above all and that's Om's "Conference of the Birds" and "Pilgrimage" albums.\u000a\u000a[Conference of the Birds](http://grooveshark.com/album/Conference+Of+The+Birds/602036)  \u000a[Pilgrimage](http://grooveshark.com/album/Pilgrimage/581049)

p909
aVComplete agreement on "Crack the Skye." Songs like The Czar and The Last Baron are perfection. There are a lot of good stoner hits off there most recent album. "The Creature Lives" is mind-blowing.

aVI wasn't aware of this.... Just another Roadburn release I want :(. I would definitely pick this up as well as the Conan-Mt.

Thanks for the heads up!!!

I will add to both parts of the list once I go through my library more.\u000a\u000a\u000aMinor edit: QOTSA and Kyuss might be stoner metal, but I've been told they're more of hard/stoner rock sound than metal.
p1046
aVSunn O))) is drone metal, not stoner metal, and Boris covers like a million genres. Still highly recommended but you might want to start them on something to the stoner metal side considering both their variety and to give a starting place in their massive discography. Good recs.
p1047
aVdrone/stoner/doom/sludge = all basically the same
p1048
aVDrone is a sub-genre of doom but stoner, sludge, and doom are all pretty different.

aVKyuss are definitely stoner metal, QOTSA are definitely not.
p1050
aVKyuss are more stoner rock. Early QOTSA qualifies as well.

p1053
aVI did listen to a lot of melodic death metal when I was younger, one of the first stoner bands I listened to was Michael Amott's Spiritual Beggars. Orange Goblin came shortly afterwards. If you have the opportunity, visit some concerts! My first stoner/post concert (Pelican/High On Fire/Suma) was almost a livechanging experience and I've found a lot of great bands by going to their concerts.
p1054
aVI'm not sure what the hardcore stoner metal people will say, but I'd suggest checking out some [Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFEDhm3dWkY), since it's pretty easy to get in to.
p1055
aVAmong what's already been mentioned, Stone Titan's Scratch N Sniff is heavy as shit.\u000a\u000aI'm assuming you probably already know this but sludge is the extremely close cousin of stoner metal so you'll find plenty of good stuff in that style as well.

VThis is not even stoner rock, much less stoner metal.  It's not bad by any stretch, though the automatic gain control on your camera kinda ruins it. 
p1063
aVThis was one of our softer ones, we had some other songs that delved into a bit of psychedelic dreamy type stuff too. I wouldn't say we were strictly stoner metal or rock just that it was an influence for sure. When we first started we were pretty much a clone of Sleep. I wish I could show some of the other stuff but the harddrive I kept it on was ruined.\u000aAlso the camera, I know :( sounds like sidechaining.

aVNah, we don't make music together anymore, I've been dying to be in a band ever since. On your other comment the equipment being used for drums is a Tama kit, cant remember what kind, but the cymbals I used were a sabian B8 for a ride. A UFIP heavy crash, and Paiste 302 cymbals.\u000a\u000aThe guitarist played a guitar called a Reverend, I dunno but I think its pretty rare. He puts his guitar through A Boss ME50 and a Hot Cake pedal, its NZ made real crunchy tone. The amp he was using was an amp that was there wasn't ours so I cant remember hahah.

VI just keep telling everyone who asks me about music, how amazing they are. If someone started something I would love to donate because I have the albums but they don't have many shirts anymore either. They should come to Canada!
p1146
aVI'm just trying to get them out of California for now!  I was just looking myself, and they are down to 1 shirt in their store :/
p1147
aVFirst few albums were fucking awesome. I was really let down by the last one, Cenotes, though. Would donate.
p1148
aVAll the reviews of Cenotes claim it to be their best effort, and that it is their holy grail.  I disagree.  I would say Metridium Fields and The Ichthyologist are on par, but Cenotes leaves me wanting more.
p1149
aVBest bet would be to email them to see if they'll accept e.g. paypal donations.  Kickstarter isn't really set up for that.
p1150
aVNice try, Giant Squid.\u000a\u000aNo but srsly you guys rock and do probably deserve some moneys.

p1152
aVAaron Gregory also has a set of t-shirts with original drawings he sells through his [Cotton Crustacean](http://www.cottoncrustacean.com/) site.  There was a KickStarter for it last November/December which I backed.\u000a\u000aIf you follow their Facebook page you can read some news about the band including:\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Translation Loss is reissuing old GS albums including 2005's Monster in the Creek.\u000a\u000a2. Monster in the Creek-era keyboardist Andrew Southard has returned to the band, which may exite those of you who like the earlier sound more than Cenotes. \u000a\u000a3. New songs are being written.\u000a\u000aI'm still waiting for the Cenotes vinyl with the comic.  I've never had the opportunity to see them and I'd love to get them to Atlanta so I could.
p1153
aVOk cool, I was looking for the Cotton Crustacean site the other day but when I found it, it just said that all the merch got moved to the Giant Squid site.  I will most likely be buying out of support, would much rather more actual Giant Squid gear.  I follow them on Facebook, so I have been pretty excited about Monster in the Creek (which I have never heard).  And I too eagerly await the comics to be released.  Must be hard to be a visual artist/musician/lyricist/ etc etc etc haha.  Thanks man!

aVThat chorus is like Remission never even happened.\u000a\u000aWhy do they let Brann sing?

aVPersonally I love Brann's voice.  Remission and Leviathan are amazing records and there's no doubt that they're pursuing a more simple song structure here, but I think it's great that they have songs like Dry Bone Valley and High Road.  Troy's voice recently has become incredibly epic as well.  Let's see how the record is in its entirety, but I understand why you might be upset as an avid Remission fan.

p1287
aV'Timing of the Void' by Eagle Claw, and 'Advaitic Songs' by Om are both great choices.\u000a\u000aEdit: Should clarify, Advaitic Songs has a little vocals, but it's more chanting than anything really. Timing of the Void is strictly instrumental, however.
p1288
aVI'll check them out, I was already meaning to check out Om, are they always instrumental or is it just this album?
p1289
aVThey've kept a pretty consistent style over the years, although they incorporated some new instruments into this last one.

p1318
aVNo preference between the two really. Completely different though so it's hard to compare, say, Bongzilla to Orange Goblin or Cathedral. It's a big genre in my opinion and to compare the two styles is like comparing Iron Maiden to Eluveitie (Or something of along those lines)\u000a

p1444
aVYes! Helms Alee is righteous.
p1445
aVThis got a little out of hand, but there's no filler in her from my perspective.  I came into this genre from a similar direction as you (Masto, Red Fang, Witchcraft) and I love every one of these albums:\u000a\u000aElder - *Spires Burn / Release* - Given your taste for Masto and The Sword, these guys are RIGHT up your alley.  In fact, get every Elder album.  You need them.\u000a\u000aGoatess - self titled - Fuck yes, this album rules.\u000a\u000aUncle Acid and the Deadbeats - *Blood Lust* - Maybe not quite the same genre as these other bands, but you'll love them all the same.  They have two more albums that are also incredible, but this is the easiest to get into.\u000a\u000aGojira - *L'Enfant Sauvage* - A bit of speed/thrash influence, with a little less fuzz and sludge than some of these other bands.  ...and the drums.  Sweet Jesus, the drums!\u000a\u000aGraveyard - any of their albums - I'm surprised nobody's mentioned them.  A bit of a bluesy influence.  Of the bands you mentioned, these guys are most similar to Witchcraft.\u000a\u000aAnciients - *Heart of Oak* - If you like Mastodon's Remission/Leviathan/Blood Mountain, you'll adore this album.\u000a\u000aMamont - *Passing Through the Mastery Door* - Super fuzzy and fat.  This is a fun album.\u000a\u000aSungrazer  - All their stuff - More of a psychedelic influence.  Vocal harmonies reminiscent of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.  So fuzzy and raw, though.  This band can do no wrong in my opinion.  **Edit - well yes, the one wrong thing they did was break up.  ...so I guess they CAN do wrong.  Fuckers.**\u000a\u000aTruckfighters - *Mania* - Almost a pop-like catchiness to their style.  \u000a\u000aVista Chino - *Peace* - This is a polarizing album.  Either you love it or hate it.  I love it.  It's so riffy, and I've always liked John Garcia's voice.\u000a\u000aWitch - self titled - The guitar work on this album is stellar.  Such catchy riffs...
p1446
aVFuckin' +1 to Truckfighters, saw them back in April and it was one of the sickest shows around.  Gojira too, but I've never really considered them stoner, more... I'unno.  Proggy hardcore?  They're kind of in a genre of their own.
p1447
aVTruckfighters are some of the most down-to-earth guys, too.  Absolutely a class act.  I've never seen them play at a venue and not hang out with fans both before and after the show.  \u000a\u000aYep, Gojira is a bit of a stretch.  But if you like Mastodon and The Sword, I can't imagine not liking Gojira.
p1448
aVOh man thanks for the effort, I really dig Truckfighters, Graveyard and Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats. I knew Gojira already, but I wouldn't line them up with the rest of the bands. Not chilled enough. :D
p1449
aVIf chilled is something you're looking for, then you'll definitely like Sungrazer.  Someone else mentioned Baroness, and I'd recommend their latest double album, *Yellow and Green* (not that you could do wrong with their other two fantastic albums, *Red Album* and *Blue Record*).
p1450
aVChilled wasn't the right expression, I'm not really into that super slow-drony stuff like Bongzilla or Acid King. I just meant that Gojira is just a little too extreme for my taste at the moment :D.\u000aThat being said, Baroness are totally awesome. Kind of like Mastodon, but entirely different.
p1451
aVCool.  I understand.\u000a\u000aI wouldn't put Sungrazer in the same ballpark as Acid King or Bongzilla.  Sungrazer's on the lighter side of the genre.  Some of the psychedelic stuff on *Crack the Skye* comes close to what Sungrazer does.  They're definitely similar to Baroness.  Check out [Yo La Tengo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBE1oIlUO4A).  It's a long song, but when the peaks hit, hold on.  There are a few acts that truly get the idea of delayed gratification.  If you love QOTSA's "You Can't Quit Me Baby", you'll get sucked into "Yo La Tengo".\u000a\u000aOh man, I forgot to mention Ghost.  I have a hard time placing them in any single genre.  Such talent there, with more than a hint of irony.  Their [Year Zero](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=video&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F62694560&amp;ei=4zm8U6nbFMWL8QHZ2oHoCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3YhMyKl1N9rBRl4UBc0Hfoj3SxQ&amp;sig2=F_dcXFWAws6Nolv_fHj03Q&amp;bvm=bv.70138588,d.b2U) video is pretty epic.
p1452
aVYeah Sungrazer are a lot less heavy from what I've heard. Yo La Tengo is really good, I'll definitely check them out! :D\u000a\u000aYeah, at first I couldn't stand Mastodon as well, I'll just give it time, maybe I'll get into it once I'm a little more used to the genre.\u000a\u000aGhost are pretty nice, I usually don't dig the orchestral/choir stuff, but they seem to make it work.\u000a

aVSleep is real good.
p1457
aVCame to say this. And it's not only good, it's definitive.
p1458
aVNo doubt they're definitive.  But I bet they're a difficult listen for OP, given his current tastes.  I love the shit out of Dopesmoker now, but I just didn't understand it a couple of years ago.
p1459
aVI get what you guys like about Sleep, but I really don't like this super slow drone stuff. It's just too boring for me :/.
p1460
aVThat's EXACTLY how I used to feel about Dopesmoker, and a large swath of stoner doom stuff.  Don't worry about it.  Someday, you may be in the mood to give it a try.  It will always be waiting for you.  For perspective, my progression from QOTSA, Priestess, Kyuss, Mastodon, etc. to Sleep, Acid King, Windhand, etc. took about 5 years.  \u000a\u000aMaybe you'll continue down the rabbit hole, and maybe not.  ...but I'm sure that someone like you, who's actively seeking new stuff like you did in this post, will always have his face melted by rad shit, regardless of genre.
p1461
aVHaha, that's true, I just checked out Mastodon a year ago and just yesterday felt in the mood to try them out again. Maybe the same will happen with Sleep or Electric Wizard ;).\u000a\u000aOh, and thanks for helping me out with all this man!
p1462
aVI guess I was just struck by how similar your tastes are to my tastes of a couple of years ago.  I still love the stuff I've recommended to you, but like you, I'm continually digesting and distilling new shit to keep me interested.\u000a\u000aThis just hit me.  Some rainy day when you have a spare 1 1/2 hours, you need to do this:  Watch [this incredibly talented pianist play Mastodon's *Leviathan* straight through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h85KV5e6t-E), and then immediately listen to the real *Leviathan* straight through.  I challenge anyone to not fall head-over-heels for this album after hearing it played so amazingly on piano.\u000a\u000aCheers!

aVYou might like Alabama Thunderpussy (they're what started me in the genre). There are a few different incarnations.

VPersonally I find stuff like Coffinworm, Ishmael, Indesinence or Bison (B.C.) to be more lock-in able for my level of heaviness tastes. To me, Conan's work can seem like random held out notes rather than slow riffs but to each their own. I do respect their level of heaviness and originality but I got their split primarily for Bongripper's work.
p1524
aVI can understand that.  I don't like all of their songs, but I am a fan of the majority of their album Horseback Battle Hammer.  \u000a\u000aDo you listen to Kyuss or Sleep?

aVactually you may have to scratch that. i'm really starting to allimate towards their [long titanic hits](http://conan-conan.bandcamp.com/track/krull). I just need to give it some time. Glad their guitar distortion doesn't melt into feedback letting you meditate on one explosion

aVConan are disgracefully heavy. Excellent band. They're the sound of the stone age. 
p1532
aVLove Conan, but judging by videos I've seen of them performing I don't think they hold it together all that well live. Studio band, studio jams. 
p1533
aVIt's always sad when bands don't perform as well live, but oh well.  We can still enjoy the albums lol
p1534
aVMaybe I'm a bit late with this, but I saw them perform live recently and they played really well. The song held up well in a live setting.
p1535
aVFrom any video I've seen it seems like the drummer is playing a completely different beat, and a little faster at that. 
p1536
aVYeah at times he did that, still great though.
p1537
aVAs a drummer, that kills me hahaha. I understand it, because I guarantee they're playing so loud that if he did the regular beat they might not even hear the rhythm the ride keeps, but I feel like it changes the mood of the song. 
p1538
aVNever heard them before, no link in the post/thread. [Here](http://youtu.be/XyHXV0g2kM4) is the awesomeness.
p1539
aVThank you for sharing the link.  It didn't even cross my mind lol

aVI love all the Conan stuff personally. I've not seen them live but I think that all of their live performances I've seen on YouTube or wherever they have been tight.

aVhey thanks Jeff! not sure how you would know that, but okay. 
p1643
aVI would say no offense but on several occasions members of your band have been cunty to myself and friends. On top of, all of you guys have a reputation around Denver of being shady, and you guys know that. It's not like its a secret or anything.\u000a\u000aYou guys have a killer band, but just not that cool of dudes. Sorry bro. 
p1644
aVhm. i've never heard that.  sorry if one of us offended you, but i personally can't recall being a douche to anyone. And shady? This is first i've heard that. Ultimately, I am the type of dude that would apologize if i did anyone wrong.  To claim that "I am aware that we are shady is" is a bit unfortunate.  What band do ya play in btw?  
p1645
aVhaha oh well. i am not asking everybody like us, but to call us shady is kinda bullshit.  We came, we played, we checked out the other bands, we got drunk, and not once did we did we do anything shady (that i am aware of). If it was our show, we made sure we could pay the bands.  You have to understand that people spreading lies/slandering us is totally offensive. And it's scene drama which is fucking bullshit.
p1646
aVim just telling you what's being said and what people think, man. it's not a secret but if you dudes are oblivious to it then i don't know what to tell you. \u000a\u000afor example, i was looking up live videos of you guys one time and someone commented on one with something loosely along the lines of "kind of funny to watch 4 dudes just fucking up sonically, and i'm not talking about the music." so it's just something that's out there.\u000a\u000ai dig the band, not the dudes. that's all.
p1647
aVi know what you talking about, and i am pretty sure they were talking about us fuckin up (which we were). To say that we are "shady" is a bit out of line, we haven't fucked anyone over, or they haven't been forthcoming. Passive aggression is not rewarded here. Sure it's possible we weren't the coolest people to some people who dealt with us, but we are just PEOPLE who have our good days and bad days. Our rep is all we have besides the music so yes, it is a matter of concern.  Cunty behavior be damned.
p1648
aVi couldnt say if it was you or someone else. you guys are known for writing sweet tunes but not being the coolest of dudes, and ive experienced it. oh well, not a big deal. but it is a common thing about your rep. maybe get out there and change it.

VYes! YES! Saw them at HDDT festival in Copenhagen. I only knew that Conan had released a split with Bongripper at that time. My friends I enjoyed some cold beers and a spliff outside when we all of a sudden hear this droning swirl, shattering the ground beneath our feet. We headed straight to the crowd and witnessed one of the heaviest acts we've ever seen or heard. Apperently, some old friend of Conan resides in Copenhagen. During Older Than Earth, their friend joined 'em live with another bass and backup vocals, making it twice as heavy - [HO-LY SPACE MOTHER OF GOD](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIlE7yzgT8)
p1756
aVYeah, that gig was beyond crazy. \u000a\u000aDavid Perry (the former bass player) is such a cool, quiet and down-to-earth guy when you talk to him, but turns into a frothing monster of doom on stage.

VThis post is making me feel old for some reason. ;)

aVCool man. Some favorites of mine over there: [Korpiklaani](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRbg1uEglEE), maybe some [Tyr](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu2bgwcv43o). If you're feeling particularly Viking-y check out some [Wardruna](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLU9gcqeOWU). Maybe try some [Monty Python metal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br3OgQVfhfM) if you're feeling adventurous. \u000a\u000aP.S. Also listen to the entirety of Songs for the Deaf. 
p1765
aVI'm sorry. when I said folk metal I meant Stoner metal. I''ve been into folk metal. It's stoner that is new to me. that's why I've never heard of kyuss. I'm really drunk right now/.
p1766
aVI absolutely love them, equally as much as Kyuss. Stylistically, QotSA began similar but have diverged more and more with each album. Every album is quite a bit different than it's predecessor, but they all manage to strike some chord that keeps me listening (to them all) over and over. Even Like Clockwork; at times a much slower, piano-heavy album, is just stellar.
p1767
aVThe first QOTSA record sounds the most like the Kyuss material. Have you heard The Desert Sessions? That's Josh Homme too, and some of his best stuff, in my opinion. A lot of the DS tracks turned into QOTSA tracks later.
p1768
aVYea, the Dessert Sessions version of "You think I ain't worth a dollar..." is awesome.  I think I actually prefer it over the QOTSA version.   
p1769
aVWhen I was younger I would just listen to the song "in the fade" over and over for hours. They are one of those bands I will always be down to listen to. Another couple life long songs for me are "regular John" and "Avon" from the self titled album.
p1770
aVI love Kyuss and I think Josh Homme is magic but I can't stand anything past the first QotSA album. Too radio-ey.
p1771
aVyeah, you're missing out big time. there are awesome tracks on every album they've put out. 
p1772
aVGarcia and Homme are both personal heroes of mine but I really don't like qotsa or vista chino. Believe me I wanted to.
p1773
aVI don't care for vista chino much. But I love QOTSA. 
p1774
aVThe new QOTSA sounds like Bowie. 
p1775
aVFor some reason I never really got into them for a while, but at some point I listened to "Songs for the Deaf" and became a big fan
p1776
aVQOTSA is not "basically the same people from Kyuss" . It's Josh Hommes solo project. 
p1777
aVThe bassist was there for a while... I believe there was another member as well. the wiki page talks about it.
p1778
aVNick was in Kyuss for 2 years.

VMy first thought was Mastodon--maybe [Aqua Dementia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Nv0YSGYR0)? There's no Leslie (rotary speaker) effect on the bridge that happens about 2/3 of the way through the song, but it does have an oddly swirly effect compared to the chugging riffery of the rest of the tune.\u000a\u000aDefinitely sounds like a Mastodon move, and it would definitely come up on a Red Fang playlist. I am not too familiar with their more recent stuff. Maybe this is your excuse to have a Mastodon day and listen to their whole catalog.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also, there's an awesome subreddit called /r/recordstore where people ask these kinds of questions.

VBongripper is awesome.  Make sure to check out their other works too.  Their newer record "Satan Worshiping Doom" kicks ass.  If you've never heard [Ufomammut's "ORO",](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb-sirShJKw) they are about the closest to that sound.  Love that band.  Also check out [Belzebong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgn9QU60jcA) who are also great.  I just realized these are all instrumental groups, is that what you are looking for?  Enoch is a group that gets over looked quite a bit, who also sound similar (but more fuzzed out) [this is the title track from their record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XzgApiM4ho), it's an instrumental also, but they do have songs where they sing in. [YOB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnijxVBQ1A4) is another group in that same vein. Most of these groups were inspired by the classic Doom groups of the 70's and 80's like [Saint Vitus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RCjEdeGmFk) who are still around kicking ass.  And even formed a Doom/Stoner supergroup called [Shrinebuilder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC9oUtrfOiw)  There's a whole world of this stuff out there.  Hang around here.  It's a much nicer place.  I used to think I liked metal until I hung around /r/Metal.

I can't stand that shit.\u000a\u000aSecond, I love Bongripper (and gonna see them on the 21st here in Denver!), and I've been listening to Jucifer non-stop lately. They kinda switch up styles a lot, but are def one of the reigning champs of doom-sludge. It's hard to find one song that encapsulates their sound really well, but smoke a bowl and peep [White Lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFS37mtOZ0) or [this sick set on NPR,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5132RkO_Sg) of all places.\u000a\u000a[Boris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-tUXR_ekBA) does a bit more psychedilia but are still heavier than Oprah Winfrey's ass.\u000a

Vnice post. i'm enjoying this.  any other good bands on this digital-volcom label you can think of?
p2147
aVIt's pretty surprising for a clothing company, but almost all of the bands on the label are worth a listen. Flood's likely the heaviest, but my personal favorites are: Red Fang, Tweak Bird, Valient Thorr, and Wildildlife (who have a split 7" with Flood)

asVBands Like ASG?
p2149
(lp2150
VGonna be really hard. ASG for me, do it better than anyone else. Just keep listening. They have a shit ton of stuff and it is ALL good and it just grows on you. \u000a\u000aBUT. The best I can do: \u000a\u000a1. Crusades (for obvious reasons)\u000a2. Valley of the Sun \u000a3. Elder\u000a4. Dozer\u000a5. Astrakhan \u000a6. Baroness \u000a7. The Sword\u000a\u000aNow in my honest opinion, it's telling to me that these bands are the closest that I could find to their sound, and I have been listening to ASG RELIGIOUSLY for the last 7 or so years. I go to all of their shows in Florida, and I have their vinyl. It's a testament to their sound and ability that a kid like me, who knows music and loves ASG, couldn't really find another band exactly like them in any way. \u000a\u000a\u000aAdded in The Sword. Also, if you find any similar bands in this great quest of yours please let me know about them. \u000a

p2191
aVok i have listened to it twice now through a decent sound system, and i really like it. everything is a lot cleaner than previous versions and heavier at the same time. i haven't listened to the other versions in the last few weeks, so i'm not sure, but it seems like this new mix is more guitar and less drums... it just seems like the drums were off in the distance during most parts, not in your face, but maybe it was the mountain of hash affecting my hearing.\u000a\u000ai need to listen to this back-to-back with the last mix to pick up on more of the differences, but overall i think it is an improvement. i'm curious what matt and al think of this version.

(lp2309
VI like where it's going...guitars sound pretty good, drums sound flat sometimes and EQ is all over the place. It sounds like you are only limited by the quality of the recording, because the songs rock.
p2310
aVDo you have any advice on EQing the recordings? We're doing it all with pro recording gear that our guitarist has access too but it's still all a bit new to us. We're planning to experiment a bit more with our next EP to see if we can improve it.\u000a\u000a[Edit] Also thanks!
p2311
aVMy only gripe would be the name of the last song, but I'm a grumpy fuck and shit like that annoys me far more easily than others, so it's probably fine.\u000a\u000aOverall, solid riffs &amp; songwriting.  Keep it up!

p2314
aVYeah, I like free stoner music, have an upvote and all the respect and support |m|\u000a\u000aRegarding the feedback: the vocals seem to blend in too much in some songs. Some changes in vocal style (I know this is easier said than done, been there myself) would definitely make this a killer record.
p2315
aVI'm with you in regards to some of the vocals.  The lower, more growly stuff sounds a bit out reach for the singer, but the higher range stuff sounds great.  \u000a\u000a
p2316
aVCheers dude. Weirdly, we did some live recordings [here](http://snd.sc/ZWJk9q), and found that live all my vocals are in the low growly range so we're hoping to experiment a bit with them in the next EP and see if I can figure out what I'm doing to get a better range!
p2317
aVCheers for all the feedback. I'll keep them in mind when we start recording again. We'll be releasing the new EP for free when it's done too so I'll post that on here for you all too!
p2318
aVWe had a go at a remaster of the EP, trying to get the EQ a bit more level and reduce the treble on the drums especially. I'll post it in the comments in here, should I repost it into the subreddit or is that not the done thing\u000a\u000aAnyway, [here](http://regulusband.bandcamp.com/) it is. Hope you enjoy!

I just have a basic pair of desktop speakers with a sub and this doesn't sound very good. While Bandcamp doesn't have a higher  bitrate it's not transcoded so it does sound a little better as you can make out the low end more.

aVI think the end goal is just finding and enjoying new music. It doesn't have to be perfect.

VConsidering Electric Wizard and Bongripper are polar opposites (in my mind at least, though I love them both immensely) in the genre, I'm just going to give you a list of my favorite stoner metal -esque bands.\u000a\u000a* Belzebong (groovy and heavy instrumental stoner metal riffage)\u000a* Pallbearer (doom with occasional funeral elements, really epic stuff)\u000a* Sleep (OG stoner metal)\u000a* Om (stretching it esp. with later releases but they're amazing nonetheless)\u000a* Ufomammut (I don't really know how to describe these guys, but stoner metal is only one of many ways you could describe them I guess)\u000a* Kamni (groovy/heavy riffage)\u000a* Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats (you'd think it was written and recorded in the 70s, somewhat along the lines of EW's later releases)
p2644
aVI saw Om live a few weeks ago and they were fantastic.  One of my favorite bands of any genre.  I also listen to Pallbearer and Ufomammut probably way too much, but those others are new and I'll give them a shot too.  Thanks much.

The best way I can put it really.\u000aEdit: Dr Death and Nothing Hill are the next two tracks on the album and can also be found on the label's YouTube.

(lp2709
VI found these guys about a year ago and they rekindled my love for stoner rock/occult rock/ doom metal. One day I'll thank them by seeing them live here in the U.S.
p2710
aVEvery time I get burnt out on stoner rock/metal a new band rears its head and gets me right back into it. If you like this kind of stuff, check out the band called Black Land, and the song Drowning Deeply. Its like Electric Wizard mixed with Nebula and a little side order of White Zombie. Its cool. 
p2711
aVgave Black Land a listen...great description. Not hooked on first listen but i'll try em again sometime.

p2723

VI never knew he was such a fan of Ian Astbury...now it seems obvious.
p2725
aVI fucking love this guy
p2726
aVWhy? 
p2727
aVI love most of the songs he's in or made, some lyrics hit close to me, and he seems like a really chill guy, and also he played with a lot of bands that aren't much similar beyond being labeled stoner, he just makes songs that I love, specially My Mind, from the new album.  It really hit me since I'm currently having some psychological anger issues 
p2728
aVNow, what's your thought process on Josh Homme?
p2729
aVI like qotsa's discs except the last one, saw them live once and was completely disappointed by his apparent lack of interest in people having fun, he came in, played the songs and got out. And also the issue with the kyuss name seemed to me like a shitty move. I still like his music and them crooked vultures rocks, but I don't know if I like the guy as a person
p2730
aVI've liked all of Josh's stuff. Haven't had the chance to see him, but aside from Dweezil Zappa I've not seen a show where that wasn't the case. The Kyuss name I've seen as right; Josh wrote a good majority of the material. I wouldn't want someone else touring under my name without me. It seems we think the same of our idols...I've always seen Josh come off as a really cool guy, mellow and awesome. Honestly I've never liked Garcia's voice. I wish Mark Lanegan or Nick would've sang the Kyuss songs, but I love them as they are. What's your favorite Kyuss album?
p2731
aVThis will probably sound heretic here, but i don't like Kyuss much, i like some songs from it, it's just to slow for my taste. I like what they all did after, it seems to me that Kyuss was something that needed to happen to launch them all
p2732
aVBurn the witch! Ha, yeah. I dig Kyuss, but, I mean, I love stoner and doom with a passion. I like slow and heavy, or slow and groovy. That Kyuss tone, though, is perfect. As for what they all did after, yeah, Kyuss was pretty necessary. Vista Chino is the bastard son of Kyuss, Songs For The Deaf is the direct evolution. Can't speak too much for where Scott's gone, haven't heard too much from the man but I'd love to see him back writing with Josh.

sVA demo of a song my band is working on. Vocals to come. How do we sound?
p2817
(lp2818
VYou know what? At first I was like, "Well the recording is a bit muddy and I can't necessarily pick everything out." Then I sat and listened and started really picking out the individual riffs, even the bass is riffing, and got the feel for the double bass. This shit is spicy. I really groove to it. Can't wait to hear the vocals. Just turn up the left guitar in the mix a bit. 
p2819
aVThanks for the kind words! These are practice recordings that exist mostly for the purpose of writing, so they are sloppy; but everything is sort of glued together and layered on purpose. There is a guitar track doubling the bass verbatim. I just like that silky smooth nastiness.\u000a\u000aI think the vocals will be blackened and light-handed, but who knows. We are coming up with this shit as we go. This is my first band, even though I've been playing forever and I am way too old for this to be my first real project.
p2820
aVI had the same reaction! It first sounds overly muddy, but it doesn't take long until you really get into it. Good job with the layering OP!\u000a\u000aIt seems like this could be a great ten minute song, with vocals interspaced every once in a while.
p2821
aVThanks! Hopefully once we go to a studio our shit will have some layered, atmospheric fullness, unlike these scratch ones... but I'm glad these get the point across!
p2822
aVI don't know shit about making music but I want to hear more. Keep it heavy!
