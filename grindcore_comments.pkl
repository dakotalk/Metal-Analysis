aVI'm just gonna wait and see.\u000a\u000aDon't expect them to go back to goregrind, in the recent Decibel article about Heartwork, they said that KEN wrote most of the goregrind riffs. Ken's not involved with this record.

asV"Grindcore is NOT metal"
p76
(lp77
VGrindcore isn't metal. It came out of the punk scene around the time metal was getting bigger and people were getting bored of the hardcore scene way back long before my time. Me and grindcore are almost the same age.
p78
aVWell, technically if it sounds more like metal it's "deathgrind" a la mid-era Carcass and such.  Old school grindcore has more in common with the hardcore punk scene and was always (in my opinion) a punk subgenre as opposed to a metal subgenre.  You can also see this punk influence in the heavily political lyrics/aspects of a lot of grind bands.
p79
aVGrindcore isn't metal. Like thrash (DRI, COC, Cryptic Slaughter) it's a hybrid of metal and punk. Thus it keeps its character; it is neither metal nor punk. Probably closer to the hardcore punk/crust side however.
p80
aVI completely agree with everything you guys say. Especially, to the untrained ear, it all sounds the same. 
p81
aVThe untrained ear also can't tell death metal from a broken air conditioner.
p82
aVIt's as metal as goth. Though gothic-metal is pretty common fusion, unlike grind-metal (if there is any), but it's taxonomically not metal unless fused.\u000aAlso while metalheads headbang and or try to look serious (especially black metalists), grind pit is more of a dance (with all the funny masks and stuff, as seen at OEF)\u000aTo casual observer there might be no difference in metal and grind, mostly due to common instrumentation, growls and heavy distortion, song structure is way more punk like, where are it's origins. \u000a\u000a(tip for further brainstorming: what would happen if there was metal subgenere that have evolved fromd death metal, sounding same as grind, making two styles with different histories but no way to distinguish them :3 )
p83
aV&gt; (tip for further brainstorming: what would happen if there was metal subgenere that have evolved fromd death metal, sounding same as grind, making two styles with different histories but no way to distinguish them :3 )\u000a\u000aWe almost got that with early Hellhammer.
p84
aVWhat would that even be called? This sub-sub-genre... I wanna say deathgrind haha, but probably not. If they're not distinguishable, but evolve due to different influences, that would be something.

VI'd like to say that this sounds more like Terrorizer than the last two Terrorizer albums. I kinda wish Pete Sandoval hired this Nausea line-up for his Terrorizer tours. Garcia sounds exactly like on World Downfall and the Del Muerte / Corredor duo does a tremendous job capturing the classic Terrorizer riffing. A really good surprise for me.
p95
aVI really enjoyed this album, and like how Nausea has grown. I will always prefer their earlier "punker" stuff but this album was fucking savage so I don't mind.

VI've been doing a grind sideproject since 2002, we're going to be releasing our discography (5 EPs) in early 2014.  Our original sound was similar to Discordance Axis &amp; Noisear, but we kind of took the Crossover thing and ran with it by incorporating other random instruments that we happen to play(trumpet, digeridoo, djembe, tin whistle, etc) I'll probably release the whole thing here for free once we finish recording out latest EP, but was wondering if anyone digs on this kind of stuff as with any "underground" metal subgenre people tend to shit on you if it wasn't recorded with a single mic in to a tape cassette in a flooded basement, or if you have a few riffs that fall outside the genre's trademark features.

sVhow to do the grindcore vocal styles?
p277
(lp278
VStart learning death metal vocal styles. From there you'll learn where you're most. Comfortable and expand to. Start learning pig squeals,  grunts,  and more guttural brutal sounds that can adjust to your style of. Grind.  Just for the love of God please make sure you're doing it properly and not bursting you throat through your nose. \u000a\u000aOr you could inhale and say you're exhaling (illfindyouandkillyouifyoudothat) 
p279
aV&gt;this\u000aI've done grind vocals for about three years now, and I've never ever done them properly. I lack consistency for how they sounded, even though everyone seemed to really like them. I somehow haven't done any damage, but it could change, so yes, please learn. \u000a\u000aAlso never inhale. Ever. Ever. 
p280
aVThing about grind core is the vocals blend well with the crazy insane instrumentals.  Where as death metal it a lot smoother than that and you pay a lot more attention to how the vocals sound. I've been doing death metal vocal for a few years and I've always practice consistency. Grind is. More preference I feel.  
p281
aVYeah, death metal vocals are definitely much more prominent and scrutinized within their genre, so getting them perfect can be important. But for grind, it needs to speak to the atmosphere, so spastically screaming with no discernible consistency or method worked perfect for me. 
p282
aVhow would I go about learning those styles too if I may ask?
p283
aVStart practising with people that know how to do it Properly! I can't stress that enough.  Starting off is the hardest part your throat will hate you until you learn to use your diaphragm.  Breathing techniques are also super important. Controlling your breath for those long notes or strings.  It's not something you will pick up overnight.  YouTube tutorials can help but make sure you're using your diaphragm and not your throat for the millionth time 
p284
aVthanks man!
p285
aVA few things to add to what others have said:\u000a\u000aWarm up exercises. I don't care if you feel silly or think you will look like a dork, do it. It's like with singing. Yes, you are focusing on your diaphragm,but you are still technically pushing your voice in a way you're not used to, so warming up keeps the vocal cords lose. \u000a\u000aTrying to go for a certain style is great. Even if you have someone more in mind(which you said you did), that will work. Just keep in mind you're not them. Your talking voice is probably different from there's, as is your singing voice. Naturally, same will be your screams/growls.Try not to force a specific sound to much. It should come more naturally. Sure, experiment a little, but if you start pushing to sound just like them, you're probably gonna start using your throat a little more. \u000a\u000aStay hydrated. It keep the vocal cord limber, and helps maintain the protective mucosal lining which coats the vocal folds and protects them from the natural friction that occurs during vocalization. Obviously, water helps. A lot. There are also some good fruits and veggies such as watermelon, cucumbers, celery, and strawberries. 
p286
aVOne thing too add, control your breathing. You can take a lot of air in, you don't have to let it out all at once. I found once I learned air and diaphragm control it started to come around. Always be wary of your throat, you can get nodes and they can turn cancerous, then you'll be whispering, believe me it's not worth it.
p287
aVYou kind of have to kind of experiment, but you don't use your vocal chords. You have to push your vox out with your diaphragm.
p288
aVYou can't be seriously asking for tuition on how to grunt like an animal?\u000a\u000aWhat next? "How do you breathe?" "How do you eat food?"
p289
aVConsidering how it takes practice to sound right and not fuck up your throat, I can't blame him.

Also I wouldn't consider Napalm Death modern, though have have been continuously releasing material, their peak has passed. As for modern grind I'd say that Captain Cleanoff, Insect Warfare, Wormrot, Mass Grave, Swarrrm, and Noisear.

aVThis is a vague question as far as some of these answers are suggesting.  Maybe you should specify on whether you mean modern on the grounds that the bands have existed within the last decade, or if you mean modern in an aesthetic sense like any Nasum-worship band or any DA ripoffs.

p535
aV Nasum are like the perfect band for me and I acknowledge their greatness but the clean, layered production and vocal style kills it for me.
p536
aVHave you heard their earlier work? Cause there is a big difference in production from their first works to their latest (which is starting to get old by now). \u000a\u000aBut I understand what you mean, seems like people either like their grindcore a little sludgier and filthier, whilst some like the "new-era" like Nasum, Rotten Sound, Gadget and that type of cleaner but perhaps faster grindcore. I have a hard time enjoying for instance, Repulsion, now that I've grown accustomed to this type of grindcore. \u000a\u000aAlso try Retaliation, a band which I rarely hear people talk about. \u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBfkssbhfhk\u000a\u000aMore brutal vocals and sound than Nasum.

aVI'm really not looking for anything super melodic, I guess I'm more talking about the rhythm structure. Im looking something more influenced by punk than metal I think. Id like really heavy riffs with fast hardcore punk rhythm. Grindcore is just so mixed up and sporadic.

I was on a similar search for my perfect blast/groove ratio and I've found it in these records. The Cripple Bastards and Magrudergrind albums have particularly amazing riffage. Obviously, Napalm Death will be thrown around alot in this thread but their latest album Utilitarian was their best work since the 2005 'comeback' in my opinion, featuring some epic, earworm-hazard riffs.

aVWormrot is awesome! Wish I could have seen them with Evisorax. \u000a\u000a&gt;tfw live in america and the music scene sucks.
p640
aVI've seen Wormrot three time in the USA. 
p641
aVWhere? I know there aren't a lot of grind bands that come through the southeast.
p642
aVDude are you kidding? The southeast rules for grind. I have seen Wormrot in Gainesville, Orlando, and Miami, and just for kicks other grind bands I've seen down here include Phobia, Napalm Death, Torch Runner, Devalued, No Qualms, Ironside, Swamp Gas, Shitstorm, Magrudergrind, Iron Lung, Bastard Noise and many many others. It is just a matter of getting involved in your local scene and staying informed.  
p643
aVSeriously? Aside from an occasional appearance in Atlanta by a bigger band, I never hear about grind bands coming through the coastal area of GA; the people who book shows around here are only interested in pop-punk and hot-topic, breakdown ridden hardcore. I think it may just be Georgia, or that I don't really know anyone else in the area that listens to grind. but I never hear about shows like those. 
p644
aVMaybe Florida just has a really good scene, but all the people involved around here are really awesome and are supportive of music. Look up 305 Fest and come down for next years. Its not straight grind, but it is a pile of fun.
p645
aVFrom what I hear from my buddies, Florida has a pretty decent scene. I just looked it up and it definitely sounds like something I'd dig; we don't do anything like that in southeastern GA. The closest thing is this thing called "Rocktober Fest" and it's 90% aforementioned hardcore and 10% pop punk; not nearly as fun, in my opinion.
p646
aV&gt;Phobia\u000a\u000aSo jealous. I don't think they can get into Canada. I really, really want to see them. I've also heard they're incredibly sketchy and often just don't show up for shows or whatnot, so it worries me to drive all the way to the US just to have them no show.
p647
aVThey weren't too sketchy, they stayed at my buddies squat house that night and it was a blast. I snagged a photo of the bassist cuddling an infant kitten
p648
aVThat's awesome! \u000a\u000aI meant sketchy with dates and stuff. As people I'm sure they aren't. I've just heard of them bailing on shows and stuff before. 
p649
aVThey never been to Canada but i've seen them twice last summer in Czech Republic. Not a lot of grindcore band are playing in Canada, so you need to go see them instead..

VI love napalm, have since 91 or 92. What I think absolutely blows away all of itn is Barney going in, using his influence to make someone see some logic. I love that he talks the talk and walks the walk, the guy is fuckin awesome. I just don't see people that talk all this shit and back it up (especially in showbiz/music). I've done quite a bit of time behind walls (15yrs) and the thought of anyone coming to help would've been awesome. He's doing something that is a courageous fight, saving the lives of some people that have done nothing more than take a substance across a line. Death! I think not, if it's multiple murder or rapes. Maybe, but how many of these people got good lawyers, cops etc... I just think Barney has earned a big shout out and a humanitarian award or something. If any of you get a chance ever, you should definitely say something to this man and appreciate the fuckin guy for being a pioneer, a political voice for the disenfranchised and now for being a good man in trying to save some lives that I think we would agree don't need to be ended.

VThis whole album is like eleven and a half minutes long. Just fucking golden. I'd def listen once through if you haven't heard it. 
p800
aVmy favorite
p801
aVThey're new vocalist is SO different from the original.
p802
aVPretty certain it's actually the same vocalist. I think I remember hearing that Lex just decided that he didn't want to continue the screaming thing in Daughters. He wanted to find a way to make them stand out from the other bands in their scene, while preserving his voice for a longer career. (Screaming like that can completely ruin some people's vocal chords.)\u000a\u000aYou can hear the beginnings of his future vocal style used on parts of the tracks "I Don't Give A Shit About Wood" and "The Ghost With The Most".
p803
aVI'm fairly certain it is a different vocalist. I watch live stuff and sometimes it's one guy, someone's is not. One live show I watched halfway through the set they changed vocalists. 
p804
aVIt's definitely the same guy, he just has long hair at some points and more recently shaved his head. \u000a\u000a\u000aFor the set where they switched vocalists, I think you are referring to this show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbAkCdaIXT4\u000ain which case he dislocated his shoulder so they had a vocalist from an opening band fill in to pass the mic around to the crowd. \u000a
p805
aVIt's the same guy, dude's name is Lex. They've been around since like 2002. Dude went major alcoholic by the end of the band then got sober. He plays with fucking invincible now. That show from above is their most recent show, they actually had to cancel a tour in Australia cause of that shit.

aV Man I knew that. I've been sleep-deprived lately and I keep doing weird dissassociative things like that.
p826
aVYou'll probably like Hatred Surge. The song Dark Circles is so new napalm death. Mumakil does that shit sometimes but they tend to stay blasting longed than grooving. Insect Warfare was like that too but on meth.
p827
aVHatred Surge was the only band I hadn't heard of yet, so I just checked them out. These guys are pretty bad ass. Might have to get an album or two later. 
p828
aVDo it. They rule.
p829
aVPost-altered state Agoraphobic Nosebleed is a lot like that, too. Agorapocalypse is a pretty perfect combo of drum machine insanity and heavy ass riffing
p830
aVI think my favorite is their And On And On split with Despise You so far, but Agorapocalypse is probably my second favorite. 
p831
aVThe split with kill the client is my favorite seven inch of all time. Im also a huge fan of their two Christmas flexi's
p832
aVYou should prolly listen to more Cattle Decapitation. They're a bit more death metal than ND but their latest album Monolith of Inhumanity might have what you're looking for.
p833
aVDefinitely try the french band Blockheads, especially from Human Parade to their last album. Exactly what you're after. But you should try french grindcore bands really, that's the most popular style of grindcore over here (later Inhumate, Infest, Untamed, Massive Charge... lots of bands in that style)   \u000aND came to play their particular current style after hearing Nasum in the early 2000's. You could go with Nasum, they're the one to credit for bringing more precision in grindcore. Rotten Sound is pretty close too (though I personally don't like them much, I'm really more of a purist)   \u000aBrutal Truth starting with Need To Control too, they're one of the bands that made the genre progress.    \u000aIf you're into more experimental stuff, I'd suggest you to try Discordance Axis as well. Intricate stuff with very original guitar work.
p834
aV Thanks, I will check these things out! Have Napalm Death actually stated their current sound to be influenced by Nasum, or is it just easy to tell? I'll have to hear when I'm not deep in some Burzum. I'm quite excited that a band is exactly what I'm after! I really get how the pure grindcore of the 90's would excite people enough for it to become such a trend, but I think it will inevitably move in this direction if it's to endure as a genre. Not necessarily pop or even rock sensibility, but people thinking about it more as composition than just cut-and-paste. That's how you delivereth the best brutality. Intricacy and original guitar work appeals to me, as I'm getting just a little tired of the standard tonality range in death metal-hardcore-rooted stuff.
p835
aVThey have explicitely stated it yes, maybe not in those exact terms but they did say that it was Nasum that made them play grindcore(-influenced) stuff again (they brifely switched to something more industrial sounding in the late 90's). To me it's quite easy to tell, although I'll always enjoy the dirtier side of Napalm Death compared to Nasum.   \u000aANd grindcore has always been about composition, and songwriting, as simple as it can be. Napalm Death is an excellent example. From Enslavement To Obliteration is a masterpiece of songwriting, for example. It's just very different of the current "brutal" labeled stuff.   \u000aOn a completely different note, I'd suggest you try the early albums of Canadian band Neuraxis. They remind me quite a lot of the later Napalm Death when they go brutal ; but they have the melodic sensibility of the current wave of technical/melodic bands. I'd sum them up as a good blend of modern grindcore and melodic death metal. As much as I am a purist when it comes to grindcore/metal or whatever, I love those guys. Check their album Truth Beyond.
p836
aV From Enslavement to Obliteration seems like great work to me, the production just kills it for me. I need to get that EQ right to appreciate the composition. It's probably just a fidelity thing with early grindcore, as even with great clarity I have to focus to grasp the structure.
p837
aVThat's part of the point of the music, really, more than it is a production thing. Density is an integral part of grindcore and it takes time to get used to it (took me several years haha, but fascination kept me going and it's now my favourite genre ever). That's part of the reason I always recommend Napalm Death for grindcore beginners, it retains the grindcore elements while being clearer than the typical band.   \u000aTry the Peel Sessions from Napalm Death, it's probably their best works, and being engineered/mastered by the almighty BBC... it's also their best sounding. The pure violence and chaos might get you off at first but honestly this is a monumental piece.
p838
aV I do quite like the density, at first it was my least favorite aspect but now I'm really into the sections of pure violence and chaos. I like just allowing the blast sections to pulverize my consciousness and immerse me in violence, and then the greatest thing is when it breaks from that directly into an epically groovy, headbanging riff and I must go nuts. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGVlp_GqiNU This track is the perfect example. I don't mind rough recording, I just like it to thud. And it just bothers me when I have no idea whatsoever what the guitars are doing. PS, Blockheads are FUCKING AMAZING. This is my shit.
p839
aVOh yes, and on the topic of french grindcore, go try Warfuck. An insane power duo from my hometown who have absolutely everything you're after.
p840
aV Sheeeeeit. This is a duo? It's awesome. Really original despite having that ever-present grindcore vibe.
p841
aV[Maruta](http://youtu.be/gsneC9Q6gqs) is worth checking out for sure.

aVI'd suggest the Grindcore History Route: Start playing along to some punk tracks. Then move to faster hardcore and from there pick up some fast d-beat and maybe pinch in a bit of old-school black metal. Start slow and get the feeling right then it gets easier to do it faster. 
p880
aVI used to sit in front of the TV and just play with my right hand on open strings, jump between triplets, patterns and straight blast and just keep pushing yourself to greater speed. \u000a\u000aI ended up with strain injuries in my hands, wrists and right elbow though so I may not be the one to ask. I can play really fuckin' fast guitar though.
p881
aVStart slow, gradually build up speed. Play with a metronome or drum track. Record yourself, get it clean slow. Listen critically to your performance. Then increase the BPM a little. Repeat.\u000a\u000aAlso, do some warm up before practicing, get your muscles loose. I often don't feel like I can get speedy until I've played for at least 20 or 30 minutes.

aV\u201cJason Schmidt\u201d and \u201cAlan Hunter\u201d were working on a screenplay while attending UCLA called Destination Time Yesterday which created controversy in the school for not referencing sources. The controversy erupted to a riot involving the Los Angeles Police Department.\u000a\u000aAfter the riot, \u201cJason\u201d and \u201cAlan\u201d were expelled from UCLA. Both \u201cJason\u201d and \u201cAlan\u201d along with bassist \u201cSven Calhoun\u201d and vocalist \u201cKalvin Kristoff\u201d begun Graf Orlock with EPs and split albums. In 2006, they started a trilogy based around the controversial screenplay starting with Destination Time Yesterday, and in 2007 Destination Time Tomorrow EP was released; which was number 16 in Decibel magazine\u2019s Top 40 of 2007. The final chapter of the trilogy, Destination Time Today, was released in 2009.\u000a\u000a\u000aI am assuming it was taken from their screenplay as it relates to the trilogy of Destination Time albums they have released previously.

It's extra odd because Scott still does a great job with agoraphobic nosebleed,  but I feel like piggy d lost the thread a bit ago.
p1019
aVI think Book Burner has some solid cuts in it, but I do agree it's their weakest album yet. However, I could see this album getting people into Pig Destroyer, that normally wouldn't listen to grindcore.
p1020
aVI always looked at pig destroyer as a band that rose above the idea of attracting fans. They all have regular jobs and only release and tour when they really want to. But book burner feels really by the numbers, like their doing it out of obligation instead of passion. Also, in terms of getting new fans, as a long time fan, I'm not super interested in talking to someone who only likes book burner and phantom limb. If you don't like grind you won't like the early records. It's like being a black sabbath fan but only liking the dio years\u000a\u000aEDIT: it also bums me out that a lot of the poetry from j.r.'s lyrics seem to be gone
p1021
aVI understand that 100%, and I agree. 
p1022
aVI heard it talked about so darned much that I finally caved and bought it. Worth having just for the unusually shaped packaging and pretty CDs. That said, how would it interest non-grindcore fans?
p1023
aVI just feel like it's a more accessible grindcore album, if that makes sense. Like if someone really wants to get into the genre with no real idea of where to start, Book Burner might be a good jumping off point. 
p1024
aVI guess I could see that, although grindcore has to be among the most extreme and least accessible genres anyway. You'd be unlikely to get into it without a path through some form or metal or hardcore punk.
p1025
aVOh yeah for sure. Only reason I say that Book Burner is accessible, is that I introduced this album to two of my friends, and they later ended up loving the genre.
p1026
aV I kind of feel like just about everything they do is the same and they could pretty much do an album on autopilot, but I still like them.

p1381
(lp1382
VAssuck. No one knows about them, which is a crime. 
p1383
aVIs this meant to be a joke? I'm actually wondering, not trying to be a jerk.  Where I'm from, I feel like everyone with a passing interest in grindcore knows Assuck.
p1384
aVI don't know a single person in my circle of metal-friends who knows who Assuck is. Napalm, sure. Repulsion, of course. But no Assuck.
p1385
aVsame with me except the people I know who know Assuck are borderline homeless/alcoholic crusties. 
p1386
aVFucking hell yes Assück. Great band. 
p1387
aVAs strange as it may seem, Agathocles. People are usually quick to dismiss them, solely based on their number of records. Their genuine musical qualities are often overlooked (seriously, Razor Sharp Daggers and Black Clouds Determinate are pure gold. On par with FETO.)   \u000aMesrine feels a bit underrated too. THey often pass for a sub-par Dahmer, for a number of reasons (both are serial-killer themed grindcore bands from Quebec...), but they musically they're quite far from each other. Dahmer almost has a gory feel at times, and can be quite intense, in an Assück fashion... Mesrine is far more d-beat oriented, and has an instantly recognizable sound (the guitar sound, mostly). Personally, I love them both equally.   \u000aRetaliation is perhaps the most cruelly forgotten band IMO. Their first releases are absolute gems of old school goregrind, the kind that Regurgitate would play after them, and their subsequent grindcore stuff is pure, hateful golden stuff. I seriously recommend everyone in this sub to get the discography album and the Cost Of Redemption. Some of my favourite stuff ever is on those records.   \u000aBirdflesh is often overlooked too because of their silly imagery, but I can't think of a better swedish band currently.   \u000aDon't get me started on the whole australian scene also haha, Australia (and Canada) currently have the best grindcore/goregrind output in the world.
p1388
aVAgathocles wrote a ton of stuff. Some was a little lacking, but they had a ton of excellent material. They were one of my favorites. 
p1389
aV[deleted]
p1390
aVProbably one of my favourites too. There's just too much good stuff from them.
p1391
aVFor me, Mesrine definitely has become way too death metal over the past however many years. They used to do that whole heavy d-beat grind which was sweet, but I think it was around Obsessive Compulsive where they started to change.
p1392
aVI agree. They still get too much shit for being close to Dahmer though. I admit I didn't like their latest output. Less fun.
p1393
aVGride from the Czech Republic.\u000aLymphatic Phlegm from Brazil.\u000aThe Kill from Australia.\u000a
p1394
aVLymphatic Phlegm is some of the strangest goregrind around, but I agree with you they're underrated. 
p1395
aVUpvote for Gride, love those Czech bastards. Saw them live at MDF2010 and they did not disappoint!

p1401
aVOh, and Ulcerrhoea, definitely.

aVWe record ourselves. We send our mixes to another fellow who does the mixing. Didn't feel like waiting to post this. these are the first 2 tracks that I recorded on vocals. Just wanted to post a taste of our new tracks. 25 more to go.
p1411
aVso do lots of bands. I guess you don't care about putting your best foot forward, or making a good impression? I would be pissed if anyone in my band(s) posted an unfinished mix. Yes, I understand and play grindcore. 
p1412
aVYou are the only one who seems to mind.  Fuck off with your shitty elitist attitude. From all I've seen, all you do is bitch. \u000a\u000aThis is grindcore. When does the sound ever out weigh the actual riffs and music?\u000a  \u000a"Yes, I understand and play grindcore"\u000a Fuck off.\u000a\u000aIm a man I have a beard. har har.

p1419
aVEh, there's so fucking many vehemently anti-meat bands, does one anti-anti-meat band really warrant scrutiny?  Same thing with anti-straight edge bands, sometimes people are just sick and fucking tired of being judged for their choices.
p1420
aVYawn. 
p1421
aVNo one seems to understand the power of Paupiettes.
p1422
aVThere are some things that are kind of interesting in here, but it mostly comes off very teenage and edgy. Lose the pig squeals: quite frankly, you don't have the ear to incorporate them well (see: the work which transforms god). Make the cover in something other than MS paint.\u000a\u000aIf you want any more constructive criticism feel free to tell me.
p1423
aVthis is probably brutal death, but nowhere close to grindcore. But sure, it's 'good promotion' to use the grindcore term as many vegan bands are coming from there. I'm not vegan at all, but this is still too stupid IMO.

p1604

VI don't know why people are saying no. Scott Hull uses a 7 string in Pig Destroyer and Agoraphobic Nosebleed .\u000a\u000aDjent gave 7 strings such a bad name.
p1606
aVThere's plenty of non djent metal bands with 7 strings.
p1607
aVExactly!
p1608
aVyes! I just posted here because there really aren't many Grindcore bands that I know of that use 7 strings and I'm looking to expand my horizons a little. Fuck Djent, I just wanna hear some grind that has a little extra low end punch. Check out [Mother Brain](http://motherbrain666.bandcamp.com/) they're a 2 piece 7 string band and they fuckin' slay! Or don't, incase you're frightened by guitars with too many strings for some reason.
p1609
aVJust showed this comment/thread to my good friend who is the singer/guitarist of Mother Brain. He has no idea what reddit even is but he appreciates the sentiment haha.
p1610
aVI love Mother Brain's ep2.  I didn't even know they played a seven string.\u000a
p1611
aVWell, maybe because Pig Destroyer and AnB aren't grindcore bands.
p1612
aVWhat? How are they not? The farthest Pig Destroyer would go would be Death Grind which I would still consider Grindcore.  Agoraphobic Nosebleed is totally a grindcore band too unless you think that having a drum machine makes you a cybergrind band in which case they are still grindcore. It's like if you are a thrash metal band you are still a metal band. They both have metal and hardcore influence, brutal speed, blast beats, and destructive vocals.  Even if you think that both of those bands aren't Mother Brain which was mentioned above is totally a straight Grindcore band.
p1613
aVHonestly, they're both too metal and don't have enough blasts for me to consider them grind.

I'll probably try and order an album when I get paid.

aVJust go up to people with metal shirts and meet them. There is no scene at all in my college town, and I come from a city with a great scene. How I came to be in a grind band, a black metal band, a blackened death band, and a doom band in my college town is I just went up to random people displaying the great music they listen to. 
p1783
aVI have on occasion, but then never seem to run into them again. Like a few years ago I was working at a grocery store, and two high schoolers came in. One had a Magrudergrind shirt, the other a Charles Bronson shirt. Ended up shootin the shit with them for a few minutes, never saw them again. \u000a\u000aBut it's cool. I'm moving in a few months. Maybe I'll have more luck then.

I play the bass and would love to start something if I can get money together for an amp. \u000a\u000aBut long story short, found out I have to move out of my house jn2 months, and I was planning to move next year, so I'm gonna do it then. So hopefully I can find people to play with. I also don't know if I will be able to order a cd like I said, but I'll probably do it when I get settled in.

VDefinitely NOT a grindcore band.\u000aBut if you're looking for "shocking" grindcore bands... Well, good ol' Anal Cunt (preferably their early stuff) and Sore Throat. Defunct french band Herpes De Crachat De Fillette (HxCxF) is perhaps my favourite "shock-value" band, they were a bunch of crazy motherfuckers. My favourite release is their split with Solstis. Hell, just check the Obscene Extreme Festival gallery, you'll find plenty of crazy stuff.    \u000aIf you're looking for pure shock, not necessarily grind bands, my pick is GISM : crazy early 80's japanese hardcore band, mixing brutal hardcore punk with melodic heavy metal (a shock in itself, and completely awesome), and notoriously crazy (vocalist Sakevi used to beat up the audience, throw working chainsaws at people and once attacked a salaryman in the subway with a makeshift flamethrower.).

aVThere's a great rumor about Sakevi that he was a Japanese politicians son and he shot an RPG at the prime ministers helicopter (and missed) and somehow got away with it due to string pulling.  If there was ever any band rumor I wish was true...\u000a\u000aThere's also a bunch more rumors about him beating the shit out of people wearing bootleg merch and yakuza ties etc. etc.\u000a\u000aAlso you can find the bootlegs of Detestation for fairly good prices and some of them are decent.  Unfortunately there is no good boot of their second album though, which to me sounds like speed metal Mega Man music.\u000a\u000a\u000a[shooting flamethrower at crowd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuXGGf2bnzQ)\u000a\u000a[Mega Man jams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjIykhFLk3w)\u000a\u000a[favorite video of their "hit"](http://youtu.be/DU4bNWseRIE?t=7m7s)\u000a

aVHahahahaha I never heard about the RPG/politician rumor, that's the craziest yet. I know he said that he would find and kill anyone who would make a website about GISM, a guy had named his GISM fansite Guy In Suicide Mission in this fashion...    I did find an excellent bootleg of Detestation years ago but it still cost me a good 50. Don't regret anything though.

sV[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?
p1945
(lp1946
VI think a fair compromise would be that the "pro-racialist" bands have a tag indicating them as such, so that way if someone wished to click their link, they would know that they are racial
p1947
aVThat way, the "pro-racialists" can post their music, allowing their free speech, and giving warning to those who don't share the same ideals not to click on their link
p1948
aVYeah, I wouldn't listen to the pro-racist grindcore bands, but as long as it's grindcore and it gets a tag it should be given a chance.\u000a\u000aAlso, the irony of giving racist bands "equal opportunity" in the sub is too rich to ignore.
p1949
aVFuck that. Everyone had the right to make the music they want, but that doesn't mean we have to support it by letting it be posted here. I don't care how good their music is, if they are racist they can go form their own sub Reddit for ignorant grindcore bands to post their music in.
p1950
aVFuck no. If racist shit starts getting posted I'd rather unsubscribe.
p1951
aVSo it's cool to post songs about rape but racism is where you draw the line? 
p1952
aVTHIS. So many times this. I appreciate the sentiment of taking a stand and being anti-racist. But if we're taking cues from the community as a whole, and if we agree that grind is generally progressive or radical in it's politics, then we're morally bound to enforce these values across ALL identity lines: race, creed, sex, gender, orientation, disabilities, etc. Any less than that and we're hypocrites. (We metalheads have a BIG ASS blind spot for misogyny, as the previous commentor points out.) And because moderating in that way would be labor-intensive and subject to heated debate, I think a hands-off, free speech, let-the-votes-sort-'em-out approach is best.\u000a\u000aThe Reddit community decides every day what kind of content it wants. Let it do its thing. The truest representation of our values will emerge from that.
p1953
aVI agree with this but it can be hard to tell which bands are actually pro-racism/misogyny or are just goregrind bands trying to purposely say offensive shit/come up with offensive song titles. Bands like Regurgitate and Last Days of Humanity have song titles that can be seen as misogynistic, but I doubt the people in the bands are actual sexists, they're just trying to go for shock value.
p1954
aVHey, I love Last Days of Humanity -- I first learned about them when my brother showed me [Bert and Ernie Go Brutal](http://youtu.be/InZNBcJTmWs), which almost made me piss myself.\u000a\u000aI hear where you're coming from. LDoH is a great example -- they clearly want to shock and offend. I doubt they actually murder women or whatever. I've even seen videos where they have a woman in the band (playing bass I think).\u000a\u000aThat doesn't mean what they're saying isn't misogynist.\u000a\u000aThe problem with what you're suggesting is that you're supposing there's some gold standard by which we can all agree whether someone's an "actual sexist" as opposed to just in it for laughs. As if it can't be both at the same time. Even if there *was* such a standard, it would still be problematic. Who gets to decide who's an "actual sexist"? What criteria does that person use? How did they get to be the authority? If that person made a call you didn't agree with, wouldn't you be pissed at them? Etc. etc.
p1955
aVI dont think this is going to change, most metal women are fucking misogynist :)
p1956
aVi don't think it's very cool
p1957
aVFuck no! are you kidding? TRUE grindcore is inherently against racism, sexism and homophobia. I don't want some shite fucking nazi garbage infecting our space! 
p1958
aV&gt; TRUE grindcore is inherently against racism, sexism and homophobia.\u000a\u000aThat's a good point. As [this other guy mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/17t69o/christian_black_metal_band_attacked_by_fans/cavvthl?context=3), black metal can't be Christian.\u000a\u000aIn the same spirit, grindcore can't be racist.\u000a\u000aI think people should look back to the founders:\u000a\u000a* Napalm Death\u000a* Terrorizer\u000a* Carbonized\u000a* Carcass\u000a* Blood\u000a* Repulsion\u000a

aVIf you're going to arbitrarily disallow the minute ratio of grindcore bands with racist overtones, then you'd  better begin the cull on the misogynistic faction, who trounce the aforementioned by sheer number and are well represented here.

p1971
aVI don't agree with the racist message but you cannot censor bands. They have their right just as the rest of us have ours. I do not condone or support pro racialist music, but to ban it would be against our right as human beings to freedom of thought.

aVI find all the responses here really interesting. There's such a large difference in attitudes towards this sort of thing between here and /r/blackmetal. I guess it is harder to ban racist music from /r/blackmetal because of the overwhelming misanthropic traits of black metal. I do support the banning of racist music... although if it is a particularly influential piece of grindcore I think there would be reason to support allowing it. But I will go out on a limb here and assume "Grinded Nig" is not particularly influential or important.\u000a\u000aI'm curious though. What does this community think of homophobic, sexist, etc. bands? Should they be allowed? Where do you think the line should be drawn?
p1984
aVYou have an insightful analysis.\u000a\u000aBlack metal has different values than grindcore. I think we'd be looking at a totally different question there.\u000a\u000aI really hate censorship.\u000a\u000aHowever, I think it's a mistake to say that any political activity of a pro-racist nature belongs in grindcore at all. Look at the founders:\u000a\u000a* Napalm Death\u000a* Terrorizer\u000a* Carbonized\u000a* Carcass\u000a* Blood\u000a* Repulsion\u000a\u000aThere is either no mention of race or strictly internationalist treatment of race.\u000a\u000aIf people were talking about a black metal forum trying to ban Burzum, Darkthrone, Graveland, Absurd, or any of the other nationalist bands, I'd say they were off their rocker. Black metal has a different set of values than grindcore.\u000a\u000aHowever, since we're in grindcore, and all the founders of the genre are pretty much in agreement on this issue, it's nonsense to say we should be "open-minded" and accept "Grinded Nig" into this genre.

aVRight to free speech guys. Reddit might not be america but censorship is wrong, even against bigots.
p2003
aVThe right to free speech prevents government censorship. PRIVATE censorship is an integral part in existing. Reddit is privately owned and operated. There's also a huge difference between censoring and refusing concession. They can take their business elsewhere. \u000a\u000aTLDR; Posting things on a message board have nothing to do with your freedom of speech, nor should it.
p2004
aVThat's all well and good but it seems counter intuitive that everyone in this thread is basically responding to hate with hate. If someone posts a racist band, ignore or downvote. There's no need for a ban in my mind.
p2005
aVFirst time on the internet: Your argument has convinced me and I'm all with you
p2006
aVI don't think it's an issue of censorship - /r/grindcore will just be removing racist music instead of preventing racist artists from making music.

p2015
aVThere's a difference offensive racist and humour racist. If it's for humour wise, who gives a shit. For fuck sake, black people write songs mocking themselves and other races all the time especially towards white people. Some for offensive purposes, others for humorous reasons. Look at Rucka Rucka Ali. He has racist parodies, but society loves it. They know how to laugh at themselves. Everyone is racist, don't act like you're not. \u000aMay I also add, look at Anal Cunt. Their songs are for the shits and giggles and they wanted to be hated. It's fucking Grindcore, not pusscore. Who the hell cares, metal has always push the limits. So suddenly we all agree dissing religions which billions of people follow to heart and that's fine and dandy but racial we think ohh no too offensive? Pfft. We push limits, we enjoy it. If they are legitimately racist, then yeah they are dickweeds but for humour? Who cares. Black comedians always joke about us crackers and it's absolutely funny to laugh at ourselves, so enjoy bands with racist names. It's enjoyment. It's no different to a band called Ranchid Chainsaw Abortion, Cunt Stomper or Scorching Babies. &gt;.&gt;
p2016
aVI'm not saying I support racist bands if they ARE racist, I'm not saying let's go spam racist songs. But, if humour wise, don't worry, have a giggle. No different to S.O.D's Speak English or Die, and they are a heavy influential crossover thrash band. 
p2017
aVYes. Racism is dumb, but so is straight edge shit, and we wouldn't ban sick fix or coke bust. Racism is just one of many stupid lyrical themes that show up in grindcore. There are some bands that are racist but have awesome riffs.there is no reason to ban bands just because their lyrics are dumb. 
p2018
aVHmm reason. Don't see that much on reddit. 
p2019
aVi can agree to that.

aVIf you don't agree with the content or the message, don't listen to it. The worst that can happen is a load of Nazi troglodytes start tapping their greasy fingers on the keyboard to leave laughable comments.

aVI still don't understand how "mincecore" is any different from grind and I've been listening to grindcore for 10 years. Care to elaborate? Probably know a few bands that fit the bill.
p2147
aVVery simple song structures with two-three riffs, heavily distorted bass, a sharper (opposite to heavy) sound, and an emphasis on dbeat rhythms alongside the usual blastbeats. Something that sounds closer to the early bands of the UK scene; as opposed to Assück (for example) or the more modern take of Rotten Sound/Nasum.   \u000aI agree it's a sub-subgenre, but it separates well a different style of grind that I enjoy more.

aVConsidering how early it was, I'd consider it proto-grind. This EP dropped before Napalm Death's Scum.
p2181
aVfor 1986, everyone who was interested in extreme music owned cassete with Napalm's demo Scum (later 1st side of Scum LP) and Repulsion's demo Slaughter of the Innocent (for US in reverse order).\u000a\u000aActually, grind didn't start with ND, numerous groups reached this speed at thier demos (and those records was constantly cirulating in underground), at least there is big open discussion who was first - ND or Repulsion

asVI really like Toxic Narcotic and Brujeria. What kind of grindcore bands would you suggest for me?
p2228
(lp2229
V"melodic" grindcore is kind of an oxymoron, but I can see what you mean...    \u000aNot exactly in the same vein as Brujeria, but in the """melodic""" vein, Lock Up comes to mind. Preferably the live album, far better than the studio albums. Asesino is probably the closest thing you'll get to Brujeria (note that i don't like either of them.)    \u000aToxic Narcotic is more of a crust/hardcore outfit rather than a grindcore one, I'd suggest going with classic 80s hardcore/dbeat/crust... From what I hear on youtube they remind me a lot of Chaos UK for a reason (my personal favorite is the split with the equally awesome japanese band Deathside) and a bit like a speedier Aus-Rotten. Try some bands from their time-period, I think you can't wrong with anything from Poison Idea, or closer to grindcore, Siege.    \u000aIf you're really looking for pure grindcore though, I'd suggest you give another try to Napalm Death, and particularly the From Enslavement To Obliteration : this is the pure definition of grindcore. I'd add my all time favourite Agathocles with their Razor Sharp Daggers album for more of the same goodness, and it's closer to the crust/punk side of grindcore than the ND album. S.O.B. is also a good choice, particularly from Thrash Night to Gate Of Doom (the first records are awesome too but are more in a SIege-like hardcore vein I think).    \u000a(and if you're ready for grind precursors : Repulsion.)
p2230
aVOh yeah, about Napalm Death too : if FETO is too noisy for you, I suggest you give a try to their more recent albums, to me the best albums to start ND are Order Of The Leech and "The Code Is Red... Long Live The Code". They're good summaries of today's ND and excellents entries to modern, "mainstream" grind, but mostly to understand the genre.         \u000a
p2231
aVhell yeah, thanks dude.

aVRighteous pigs. One of the most pissed off and Sickest grindcore bands there is period.

aVhttp://www.music-map.com/brujeria.html
p2234
aVand maybe one more, musically not that related but lyrical themes and mood is, (and also that spanish-y thingy), Ratos de Porão
p2235
aVNot pure grindcore, but close in crusty atmosphere are Weekend Nachos and Nails, if you want something dirty and grindy go Brutal Truth (not the last album though IMO), Insect Warfare, Swarrrm and their japanese fellows 324. Also Venomous Concept for cool crusty grinding. For something darker, you can't go wrong with Dephosphorus. And for something groovy, Homo Iratus..\u000a\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBUrLBQgXUw\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUKVwkxQ6yA\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh932P28Yto\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZB9bNA0KWg\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59-zlxYFy7I\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia0-cEWCvuA
p2236
aVI've absolutely never understood why Venomous Concept gets so often tagged as grindcore. I mean, sure the band members are almost all grindcore legends, but the music is 100 % Poison Idea worshipping (right up to the name). It's awesome hardcore punk and I love them, but it's definitely not grindcore.    \u000aRecomending them is fitting, of course, but I hate seeing them tagged that way. It would be like saying Lock Up is a melodeath band because Tompa and Tätgren did vocals for them.

VI legitimately know these dudes! I'm not sure if you're also from the St. George area, but they've since fired their vocalist, Ammon, and had their drummer and bassist take up vocal duties. Their newest album, [Life has Departed](http://toxicbreedsfunhouse.blogspot.com/2014/02/song-premiere-fever-dreams-failure.html) was recorded with Taylor Young of Nails and it is fucking DOPE. As an attempted claim to fame, these dudes played in my house once. I have their old-ass shirt to prove it.

aVLooks awesome. Also, I've always wondered since I have absolutely no artistic skills but end a bunch of records, how does it work formatting it for a record? What do you usually originally draw it on and then how do you get it the right size? Do you end up using photoshop?
p2355
aVHey ISuckCocks4Money, I draw it on white card with black ink then scan it in. Using photoshop at the moment but I don't do so much to be honest. I just crop out the unused card. The image there is actually scaled down as the logo's were really small and that was about as large as the logo's could get without going far too pixelated. Normally when an image is sent off to be printed as a record sleeve you will be asked to set the image on a template to get the right size.

aVI hate myself for having to post [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSwqnR327fk)
p2392
aVI'm sure you could rip a basement recording grind session to a 64 or 96 bitrate mp3 and maybe fit more than 1/3rd a cd quality track on a 1.44mb floppy.  They have rough quality already, so I don't think the downsampling of having a lower bitrate would really be that noticable.\u000a
p2393
aVthey have 1.4 MB, so that is around 1 min of music at 192kb/s or 9 minutes at unlistenable 16kb/s for cell-phone recording quality midi recordings.  It is a minute long ~*exclusive*~ track plus a .txt file for the insert

(lp2399
Vbecause why not. no rules.
p2400
aVShorter songs and less of an adherence to verse/chorus/verse structure\u000a\u000aI also like the incomprehensibility - you get some really nice poetry if you read the lyrics, but only if you read them.\u000a\u000aIt also helps contrast with the music: Bone Awl is chaotic, angry grind/black metal, but they have really poetic and poignant lyrics.
p2401
aVWhen Napalm Death had recorded the SCUM album they had already recorded guitars/drums before Lee Dorian joined. During recording of his vocals they had to give him signs at the parts when he had to do his growls. Not to mention that all lyrics were probably written post-recording. IMO this turned out great! On the contrary it's a little bit awkward if you can follow the lyrics on Nasum or Phobia songs. But anyway, if that's turning you off grindcore then it's maybe the wrong music genre for you!? Or just get used to it! So much fun! In the end: what it's all about is that the vocals are just another instrument/wall of noise.

Either way should be a killer release!  I am glad that its coming up soon though, I cant get enough Headless Death.

aVAlso I see he's still wearing that Speedwolf shirt, unless this was Richmond? Don't think it is though. \u000a\u000aSpeaking of which, fuck that venue Kingdom for not opening the doors for a few hundred people waiting outside until 2 minutes before Speedwolf started playing. I finally made it to a show they were playing, and I didn't make it inside in time to see them. Fucking assholes. 
p2489
aVI saw them in Birmingham, AL. Speedwolf ruled, Exhumed ruled, Napalm Death ruled, Municipal Waste ruled. Only thing that sucked was the venue. It's a regular venue in Birmingham and the security is just ridiculous. Kids get thrown out instantly for jumping on top of people or even making an attempt to stagedive. No warnings or anything, they just damn throw them out of the show.
p2490
aVAll around a pretty good touring package, but I can't get into Municipal Waste anymore. I wasn't even planning on staying, but Napalm + a lot of whiskey and beer got me in the pit, so I was still kinda riled up. So I stuck around, for the whole set even. But I couldn't get into it, man. Maybe it's from being in Richmond, maybe it's bias from being exposed to some of those dudes too much outside of shows they're playing...but I just thought it was extremely boring. \u000a\u000aRegardless of that, Municipal Waste definitely should not have been headlining over Napalm. That's fucking retarded.

p2614
aVBoth assumptions were correct! We did use a drum machine, because we lost all our drummer candidates, but the drum machine we used sounds fairly close to real studio drums. It still is a drum machine though. We hope to find a drummer to record the drums of our next EP. \u000a

VYou probably won't like what I am about to tell you, but it is not my job to sit here and ego-stroke some stranger on the Internet either. If you are genuinely interested in getting some feedback in you work please bear in mind that this is my subjective opinion. If you want to hear that you are fantastic human being and that your band is awesome stop reading now. \u000a\u000aI would prefer a better mix / recording, too little bass and groovy mid range. The vocals are mixed to loud. Human Tools have this annoying guitar in the end that makes a little melody, like four notes at 01:51, that thing make the whole song fall apart, it sound super naive to me. In general the guitar sound is rather shitty. I can hear certain parts when you would like the guitars to be rhythmic and drive the thing forward, e.g. 01:07 in Manufactured Dissent, it just doesn't work. I'm guessing that you are using some cheap distortion pedals for the guitars. Regardless you have no dynamics in the guitar sound and nothing to work with to make an effect. \u000a\u000aI'm guessing you are going for that 80's punk / hardcore sound that sound really garage and ad hoc. That is a noble thing to go for. The only problem is that out of 2000 recordings made one where a lucky accident and sounded OK. Those are the ones that people tend to remember. There is a reason Beat the Bastards is 100 euros on discogs. If you want to get something to sound like something then you have to do your homework. \u000a\u000aMusically it is not that new, but I cannot blame you, metal (all variations, punk, hardcore, grindcore included) tend to be super conservative. Rehashing the same old stuff over and over again. I don't mind per se since that is what the whole metal thing is about anyway and I like it. I mean, every time a band tries to break out of the mold and be innovative they get tons of shit from people that are insecure about not being metal enough. Like Carcass for example, if I would get a dollar for every time someone said "they where better on their first album", fuck no, they where shit compared to Heartwork, and I would be rich also. \u000a\u000aWhat else to say? I think you should be proud that you got together and recorded something. Keep rehearsing and get better at what you doing and I suppose things will fall in place one day or another. 
p2629
aVDude I needed this, thank you. The production IS bad; it is all home recorded and the guitars were run straight into the computer for after-effects. We weren't going for a clean sound and it is pretty obvious. Tapes wouldn't even be fair if we did go for a clean sound. It may be beating a dead horse, but hey, I am sure enjoying myself and I hope someone will too at a show. The community here doesn't even want a Carcass, they want something raw. At least I can say we will take your words into consideration, fix production, improve composition, and attempt to progress a scene and genre. Thanks 
p2630
aVYeah, as I said, you should be proud and happy that you came together and something, it is much much harder to so that than sit at home and complain. I know I sound super negative, that is not about you or what you do or anything of that matter, it is about my subjective appreciation of your actual music. To be fair I think there is a great deal of potential to work with, I mean you got the basics down and now it is a matter of polish and iteration. I have been playing in bands, and one thing that was all too common was that people just gave up when demos didn't turn out that great. Persistence is key! Anyway, nice seeing someone hanging it out there for some community consideration.

p2735
aVThanks for that - personally, I detest politics in my music, but I'm prepared to persevere nonetheless! Not tried either of those bands, so I'll go with your recommendation with thanks.
p2736
aVThanks to all those who have identified this post as a genuine request for input and not a post intended to offend or criticise unfairlly this genre. Thanks to some of the replies, I have listened more intently to several bands within the genre and am beginning to like them. So thank you. Shame about the trolls that seem hell bent on being offensive, but they can be ignored.
p2737
aVSeeing as how no one is answering your question I'll give it a shot. I have only been listening to grindcore for a short time now, but as you already listed the aggression and speed are the main point that I find appealing (but then again I listen to a lot of extreme metal so this is second nature to me.) But what also appealed to me was, in the case of Pig Destroyer, was the lyrics. While just like most metal genres it can be really vulgar, but also very philosophical. Each song shows an insight, a reflection of vulgarity not easily expressed. It's also a nice change of pace after you listen to black, doom, or prog after an extended period of time. It's not necessarily that you're tired of a specific sub-genre, it's just that it's a nice change.
p2738
aVThis is one of the things I was gonna say. Although some of it is kind of more silly, there are plenty of grind bands with great lyrics. Whether its political or jyst about society in general. \u000aI also like the fact that it can simply be fun to listen to. Sometimes thats the best music there is. 
p2739
aVThank you for replying. The point about the lyrics is very interesting and it has prompted me to go back and actually explore the lyrics in a bit more detail. I must admit that, having given it a bit more time, there are some things that are beginning to click with me, but it will be a long process I'm sure...plus I doubt it will ever be my favourite genre if I'm honest. Thanks again.

V If they could just stop sounding like they're signed to Century Media, I could get into this. Also, it pisses me off that I could pick up a guitar and write better riffs than Mitch Harris in about 30 minutes and he insists on continuing the CHUGGACHUGGASLAYERSLAYER thing he's been recycling for the last decade. I should add that my disappointment is only this passionate because Utilitarian has become my favorite album of theirs. I really hope this is a weak point on the record. I should be more hopeful, because I remember Leper Colony being the only track they shared in advance of that album and it's one of my least favorites.

p3029
aVI was streaming and double checked with another source to see if it was my headphones but it wasn't. Really unfortunate as well because I really liked the sound of this.
p3030
aVis it the Copmuter side or the HFR side?\u000a\u000aedit: the HFR side *is* mono but it plays on both channels on my setup
p3031
aVI haven't actually checked on a different PC or on mobile I might do that tomorrow. All I know is that it doesn't work now and it couldn't be my PC, headphones or anything else because all other audio works. 
p3032
aVthat's really odd and I wish I knew how to tack that down for you. I definitely have full stereo on my side (Copmuter) but I can see how HFR's mono side might cause strange issues on some setups\u000a\u000aI'll get a hold of him and see if he doesn't mind me fucking around with his source files to at least just convert them to "stereo" (it would just be the same mono channel on both sides) and I'll see if that doesn't fix things\u000a\u000ahe's a very analog kinda guy

If I consider only grindcore/goregrind though, it'll go something like this :    \u000aAgathocles - Razor Sharp Daggers   \u000aNapalm Death - FETO   \u000aExulceration - split with Putrid Offal   \u000aRegurgitate - Effortless regurgitation of bright red blood   \u000aTerrorizer - World downfall   \u000aDead Infection - A chapter of accidents   \u000aPretty much everything by Archagathus and Hyperemesis is pretty much joining this list.

p3132
aVFlesh Parade - Kill Whitey
p3133
aVExcruciating Terror - Divided We Fall\u000a\u000aI come across more people who prefer Expression of Pain over this one, but while the production is so savage on Expression, I just think ExTx did more interesting things with their riffs throughout the songs on Divided We Fall.  Besides, some of the guitar slides still sound like a revving motor, so it's a far cry from some Nasum rip-off in the production department.

aVPig Destroyer - Phantom Limb\u000a\u000aThe Berzerker - Dissimulate \u000a\u000apg.99 - Document 8
p3141
aVokay, so the Nails and Dead in the Dirt thing never made total sense to me (i've always felt they were more "crust-y" punk/blackened hardcore with occasional blast beats), but pg.99? really?
p3142
aVI think old screamo like pg99 or orchid shares a lot of similarities with grindcore. Obviously, it's not a heavy, but I think the visceral chaotic song structure is very reminiscent of grindcore. So maybe it's not actual grindcore, but I think it's grindy enough that it deserves a mention. I mean they did splits with Pig Destroyer and other grindcore bands so it's not like they were in a completely different scene or anything.
p3143
aVI mean don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan of all three bands I previously mentioned, and I feel they share some similarities with grindcore at times in certain songs musically, but I don't feel that they're aesthetically or "spiritually" what grindcore represents. I don't know, does that make any sense at all? Hahaha. 
p3144
aVyea, i totally get what you mean in that aspect. and you are right about that. I was thinking more musically when I made that post.

p3170
aVAs soon as I joined, I looked right for a grind sub, not to mention the black metal sub as well. That sounds like a good idea though. Not alot of people are into grind so it's hard to get them into it. Hopefully some more people could come through. I'm sure the powerviolence guys have some good stuff to share.

All it takes is a few people to talk to a moderator and boom! Posts deleted and who knows how far people will go.. It's worth a shot though 
p3174
aVI have a feeling that once /r/deathmetal and /r/hardcore get some non-death metal and non harcore songs swapped to this subreddit things will begin to run more smoothly for all parties involved. I also just started reddit.com/r/musicwithoutahome to discuss anything else that interests you guys. What it means to you, how you react to it.

New York City\u2019s most imposing purveyors of angry electronic mayhem met in pitched battle to determine who truly has the most dangerous beats in town. Digit216, the crowned king of cybergrind calamity, launched a barrage of mega-ton kicks and a seemingly infinite arsenal of bulletproof breaks. Speak Onion, the #1 boss of drum\u2019n'noise, let loose a plague of toxic chemical synths and flesh-eating effects. After 5 rounds of chaos, the only clear winner was the crowd of on-lookers, left with gaping jaws and shattered eardrums. \u000a\u000aFortunately, a pristine recording from the mixing board has been uncovered, so the historic Battle At Silent Barn can take its place in history. Immigrant Breast Nest will bring this event to light so the world can hear the dangers of armed electronic conflict and the horrors of breakcore war. Hopefully society can learn from the past and such carnage will never repeat itself. Actually, scratch that, this shit crushes. Once you get this in your head, you\u2019ll want it to happen again on a sound system near you.\u000a________________________\u000a\u000aLet me know what y'all think.\u000a\u000aI'm currently working on faster grind based stuff too.

asVWhy did Repulsion only release one record if they are still active?
p3213
(lp3214
VBecause they already released the best grindcore album of all time, there's no need for a followup 
p3215
aVAlthough there is no denying the supremacy of 'Horrified' (I am proud to own an original Necropolis press), the live Repulsion shows need to stop. It's just embarrassing at this 'stage.' I understand it's a steady income influx for the folks involved, but there is something to be said for not massacring your reputation by flogging a rotten corpse. I would bet that the band have tried to write additional material (post 7"), but it just could not stand beside the original stuff. To their credit, few could ever replicate the feel of such incredible grindcore, even today,  including the same damn band. Cretin do a fine job, but nothing will ever match the original. 
p3216
aVI kind of agree about the live shows but I saw them at MDF 2010 and I thought they were great, although I bet they are better inside.  I don't think they play that often live so I am ok with it.    
p3217
aVNot sure which line up you saw but I caught a live set of theirs recently in Portland with the original singer and they were spot fucking on. One of the best sounding live sets I'd seen in a while. They had the drummer of LA black metal band Exausted Prayer on drums.  
p3218
aVIts kind of the same thing as Bolt Thrower (although they released a lot more albums than Repulsion).  They felt they couldn't release anything that held up so they haven't but still do live shows.  \u000a\u000aAlso if your looking for current Repulsion type bands....check out Modorra - Solar Anus.  Holy shit that album rips
p3219
aVI believe they broke up for personal reasons after that album, some members had family commitments, and I believe another joined the military. They re-formed semi-recently, I think. \u000aI may be wrong, I only discovered the band recently.

p3379
(lp3380
VI love my vocals high pitched. I like my riffs more punk/thrash oriented a la Magrudergrind. Basically grind that leans more towards the punk side rather than the metal end of things. 
p3381
aV[deleted]
p3382
aVWith a death metal influence.
p3383
aVFor me grind has to be more on the punky side (like the crust/grind stuff as Disrupt, Extreme Noise Terror) and vocals more high pitched or mid. I don't mind if it's straight on blasting, but it's better if there are breaks and stuff (like Nasum, btw the best Grindcore band ever). Very important are lyrics, should be political or at least personal stuff. The porn/gore stuff is disgusting and has nothing in common with grindcore.
p3384
aVI prefer my grind to sound rotten...like Rotten Sound. 
p3385
aV* Repulsion\u000a* Carcass\u000a* Napalm Death\u000a* Dead Infection\u000a* Terrorizer\u000a* Assuck\u000a\u000aIt has to be on the level with those.

p3389
aVI like my grind to be empowering - to make me fill like I want to kill someone, not myself.  Insect Warfare, Wormrot, Phobia, Agathocles, and Excruciating Terror are my favorites.  And all of those bands have achieved that perfect medium in sound quality.  The quality of their music, however, is impeccable.
p3390
aVOf course I listen to grindcore with &lt;20 second songs, but my favorite is definitely &gt;1min songs.
p3391
aVOld school crustgrind, which I generally mix in with thrashy late 80s UK hardcore like Ripcord or Extreme Noise Terror and fast and raw crust bands like Doom, Napalm Death (first 2 albums), Atavistic etc...I usually think of it more as crust/punk than grind.\u000a\u000aAs far as 'real' grindcore goes I'm a big fan of any West Bay Coaltion band, Agents of Satan, No Le$$, ETO, Plutocracy. The riffs, grooves and blasts have it all. I also fucking love powerviolence and I'm not really sure where the line is drawn between em. Lack of Interest, No Comment, Manpig, SPAZZ, Neanderthal, Mind Eraser, Apartment 213. All rad.\u000a\u000a
p3392
aVIt just has to be pissed off and raw and real. Emphasis on that instead of tech. Bonus always if the drummer has a good blast.
p3393
aVFun!\u000a\u000aIt's faster and more brutal than punk, with more distortion than death metal, raw expression, but it's not to be taken too seriously, without political issues, especially live it's more of a dance music. It's also my favourite guitar-genere to be incorporated into electronic music.\u000a\u000aAnd there is something about those 20 seconds to one minute songs, why to listen to same chorus several times, if the idea is only for few seconds than play it only for few seconds.
p3394
aVI would love to see this sort of thread over in /r/musicwithoutahome\u000aJust created so bear with us for a while but these conversations come up quite often around here and I'd argue that a subreddit utilized to discuss music, how we define it and the technical/emotional impact these types of music influence ourselves. The heavy metal guys, the punk guy, grind, powerviolence, it's all the same shit.\u000aI propose we join forces in musical discussion not to agree or disagree on who came from where or where it will go. Just an unbiased look at the state of things as they are, and what that means to us. Basically, an intervention.\u000a:Now you know I love your growling and blast beating and downtuned guitar riffs guys, but what are these weird little sludgey parties halfway through? Followed by a legitimate explanation of why musical option #452wy42 really irks user kletusboblastbeats.\u000aCould end in flames, could help the furthering of extreme genres and appreciation of them at best.

aV"Grindcore that isn't carcass worship"\u000a\u000aThat gave me a chuckle. Just listened to the album. Loved it. 
p3558
aVI'm honestly not a fan of carcass at all. hate em. so since most goregrind is just a bunch of dudes who really like carcass playing carcass riffs under a different name, I'm not a fan of most goregrind.\u000a\u000athis album has its own identity, which is awesome.
p3559
aVWhat's funny is that Regurgitate's First Release "Effortless Regurgitation" has that Carcass- Reek of Putrefaction worship vibe.\u000a\u000aThere's alot of goregrind bands that don't completely rip carcass
p3560
aVWhen I met carcass a few months ago. I got them to sign my Symphonies of Sickness and reek of putrefaction albums. An I think it was Jeff that said "I'm surprised someone so young (I'm 19) has heard these albums"\u000a\u000aAnd my buddy turns to Jeff and says. "Well no one has really 'heard' the first two albums"\u000a\u000aWe all shared a good laugh. 
p3561
aVCarcass is one if my all time favorites. But when it comes to good ol fashioned Grindcore I thing Exhumed is a better fit. \u000a\u000aI can totally get why some people hate carcass. I (now this is only my opinion) can kinda see them as the Metallica Of Grindcore. \u000a\u000aAs Cannibal Corpse is the Metallica of death metal. \u000a\u000aJust my opinion. 
p3562
aVtotally understand that analogy, ahaha. 
p3563
aVFuck man, I thought I was the only one.  Carcass and their worshippers like Impetigo, Exhumed, Impaled and so on and so on were just so damn boring. I don't care for gore lyrics at all but I don't particularly care about most of the preachy, sometimes silly political lyrics of the grind I do like either. \u000a\u000aEven besides the silly/awesome album cover, I always liked this album a lot too. I'd like to listen to more goregrind but any bands I try out usually just sound like early Carcass. I'd definitely love to check out more shit like this album.

aVHow about that? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2zKzv6okEM\u000a\u000aThough not sure what you mean about noisecore and then mention DA.
p3635
aVThe last thing you wrote sounds too much like what I'm doing at the moment: I've told my bandmate that I want something that sounds like "Mildred Pierce" with blastbeats.  Get out of my head! (It's turning out more like Gerogerigegege meets Slowdive anyway.)  \u000a  \u000aThese are the two closest things that I can come up with for active abstract grind projects at the moment:  \u000a[AKBK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7VqzyaG2VA)  \u000a[Brutal Blues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spHT6n0Uxkg)  \u000a[Sissy Spacek](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pRaOtnKn3w) - not my thing but maybe you should try it out  \u000a\u000aThese aren't really like what you were necessarily looking for, but I'm in the same boat as you.  I couldn't think of any relevant noisecore to post at the moment but I don't know if that's really what you want in the first place.
p3636
aV I would like to hear this band if it ever develops into something, I'm trying to imagine what Gerigerogegege meets Slowdive would sound like and it's cracking me up. I have never heard them mentioned by the same person, ever. AKBK are fucking thrilling, I find their album really boring compared to their live show though unfortunately. More grindcore bands should do raw, spontaneous live-in-studio sessions with good, basic recording. I wish John Peel was still around.
p3637
aV&gt; More grindcore bands should do raw, spontaneous live-in-studio sessions\u000a\u000aThat's pretty much [Noisear](http://noisear.bandcamp.com/album/subvert-the-dominant-paradigm)'s mo ([source](http://blowthescene.com/interviews/noisear-interview.html)).

p3646
aVI checked them out the other day. Only stuff I could find on YouTube were very low quality live videos. Couldn't really hear much of it, but it sounded alright. I typically don't care for hardcore, but I'll give it a listen when they have an EP out.\u000a\u000aAnd I agree 100%. There's a ton of other great grind bands out there, but, those two bands really carved out their own piece of the grind world.

VThe [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_violence) is certainly enlightening, I'm learning right along with you about powerviolence. \u000a\u000aI can't extrapolate on PV more than that, but I can suggest a few of my favorite grindcore bands: \u000a\u000a* [Priapus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFhbdZ8vCFY) - intense bursts of violent deathgrind with emphasis on grind\u000a* [Fuck the Facts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ15tYs97fA) - a bit progressive female-fronted grindcore\u000a* [Plague Bringer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfBuWtYQJ7A) - cyber deathgrind (two members and a drum machine, [fucking love these guys](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Plague_Bringer/59590))\u000a* [Genghis Tron](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqGU6YuBjOc) - progressive cybergrind? Electronic sounds, terrific stuff, that video is wacky\u000a* [Margrudergrind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhOCUlMWA8M) - pretty big right now\u000a* [Pig Destroyer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP3Xmc8JMGE) - the best grind band ever IMO\u000a* [Leng Tch'e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_aoY7FtTzI) - great quality stuff for fans of Cephalic Carnage\u000a* [Call of the Void](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dv-YrIe7NY) - grindcore/sludge/hardcore/metal with emphasis on the grind\u000a* [Agoraphobic Nosebleed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RslA81J2E0U) - unrelenting grindcore, Merry Chrystmeth!\u000a\u000aEdit: more bands
p3687
aVI got my name from a [Fuck the Facts song!](https://soundcloud.com/discorage/03-fuck-the-facts-disco-rage) (song starts around 1:16) This is back when Topon did vocals. 
p3688
aVThank you for the band suggestions! Actually one of my friends always wears this really sick Pig destroyer shirt and he says the same thing about them being the best grind band so now i will definitely have to check it out. 
p3689
aVI would suggest starting with [the entire *Prowler in the Yard* album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJGbH781DWY), it's only about 35 minutes long. It should be listened to as an album.
p3690
aVFucking right, one of the best grind albums of all time, if not the best.
p3691
aVThanks!
p3692
aVOk so power violence is basically grind punk. Typically it is done in a fast punky/grind all out attack, then usually goes into a mid tempo rythym, then back to a faster pace. Check out Crossed Out, Spazz, California Love, Charles Bronson. All great PV bands. The PV sound entails a grind sounding guitar, blown out bass and your typical grind blast beat or D-beat. The songs are usually short, akin to grind. If you want some good grind bands, obviously you should start at Napalm Death and Carcass. Those are pretty much the innovaters of the genre. Repulsion, early Bolt Thrower, Extreme Noise Terror, Assuck, Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Anal Cunt, Apartment 213, Pig Destroyer, Noisear, and Lock Up. All really good grind bands. Once you find a few you get into, just delve deeper and deeper man, you'll find alot of good stuff. Also if you dig crust punk, check out Discharge, Heresy, Anti-Cimex and Mob 47. All of those bands I just listed, influenced grindcore heavily.  
p3693
aVSorry for the wall of text and no links, on mobile.
p3694
aVThank you for all of the information man! Also I do already listen to Napalm Death and some Carcass. I appreciate the time you took to type all that, and it's no trouble at all without links, I can type haha. \u000aSo with PV does the punk mean there's less harsh vocals? Because i feel like I've noticed more yelling and less screaming and growling. Or is that just a coincidence?
p3695
aVIt's no problem. The more people that get into grind, the better! But yea, I would even say the songs have a bit more of a punk structure/feel, played super fast. As for the vocals, I would say yes to more yelling and mostly the bands usually don't growl. I remember the first time I heard the "typical" PV vocals, I laughed pretty hard!

aVDr. Acula isn't grind.  Check out Neanderthal and Man Is The Bastard. They invented powerviolence. Also, the endless blockade and suppression are some great powerviolence.  
p3700
aVPowerviolence is the other side of the grindcore coin. Bands that draw heavy influence from the first DRI record, sore throat, siege, deep wound etc.  Basically, dudes who heard some of the illest and fastest of the early hardcore bands took that vibe and pushed it further. \u000a\u000a Check out Pissed happy children, Cyclops, Neanderthal, and Man is the Bastard in that order and you can follow some of the progression from straight nasty mid 80's hardcore to its own unique freak style.

aVI seem to be the only ND fan in existence who thinks this is shit, it's piss weak when compared to their earlier shit and is lacking the real chaotic grind element that made me fall in love with them
p3743
aVI can understand why a Napalm Death fan may not like the newer material. It is substantially different from the earlier stuff, and it doesn't have that raw spastic, crusty side.\u000a\u000aThat being said, I think one thing that helped me kind of bridge the gap between the newer material and the old is that songs like this are chaotic in a different way. The increased technicality (in my opinion) makes it possible for more variation, and a wider swath of song structue. In comparison to the straight blasting of records like 'Scum,'  songs like "In Deference," "Everyday Pox," and "The Great and the Good" throw in some major surprises, which is made possible with the newer style. I think there is more chaos, but more structure at the same time.

p3762
asVCan you guys recommend me some bands that are similar to gridlink?
p3763
(lp3764
VTo start, look into members' other projects. Mortalized was Takafumi's previous band and has a similar sound. Discordance Axis obviously. Bryan is in a kajillion bands, some better than others; Noisear's *Turbulent Resurgence* continually blows my mind but it's much less melodic than GL and takes a few listens to start to get. Human Remains is great; I'm partial to their demos. Finally, Hayaino Daisuki is basically GL with a different drummer. Ahhhhh, Gridlink. My second true grind love. After you've exhausted all the side projects etc., if you're anything like me, you'll have nowhere else to turn but Insect Warfare, who are technical and melodic in a very different sense.
p3765
aVI do enjoy Insect Warfare and Hayaino Daisuki. ill check out the other projects though. thanks for the help!
p3766
aVSort of off topic, but is Insect Warfare considered technical? Fast, obviously, but their riffs have always felt pretty simple. Not knocking it; they're my favorite grindcore band and that's a huge part of the reason. Is it the drumming? Stellar, but I still don't think I'd call it technical. Just curious.
p3767
aVHave you heard [Beaten To Death](https://beatentodeath.bandcamp.com/album/d-dsfest)? They have an interesting approach to melodic grind.
p3768
aVWow these guys are great! thanks!
p3769
aVMortalized *should* be the obvious choice because Gridlink really gets more of their sound from Mortalized than they do Discordance Axis.\u000a\u000aThese choices are a little closer to DA than they are Gridlink, but I would recommend listening to Morphic Lapse and Krupskaya. I don't like White Eyes but you could check them out, too. \u000a\u000aEven further apart, but maybe Splitter? That's closer to Nasum meets HHIG territory but I thought of them for some reason. 
p3770
aVOnly one I can think of  is [Kataplexis](https://kataplexis.bandcamp.com/).  Gridlink is pretty unique though.

aVwhats the status of LDOH these days?  I saw them back in 2011 at MDF and havent really heard much from them since
p3817
aVI found it odd that Mark switched from drums to vocals position. Anyone knows any reason for the change? \u000a\u000aI also notice a total lack of activity in all current (or previous) band member's side projects, like Urine Festival, Tumour, Intumescence, etc. Seems like they all grew up or what?
p3818
aV&gt; They just created an official facebook page. They do have a couple of releases planned which is killer. Here was their announcement from facebook.\u000a&gt; "This is the offical Last Days Of Humanity facebook page, there are more LDOH fan pages out there, but this one is the real deal.\u000a&gt; Latest news:\u000a&gt; We just recorded new tracks for a split mcd/10"/9" with FUBAR. The 10" will be released by Fatass records from Poland and the MCD and 9" will be released by Haunted Hotel from the USA. The 9" will be a USA exclusive only release.\u000a&gt; Last Days Of Humanity will be working on other new tracks in the near future. Line-up today is Rogier Kuzee and Hans Smits.\u000a&gt; Stay tuned for more info, pics, noise and gore."\u000a\u000a
p3819
aVHans Smits? That's the former vocalist right? Curious about the drums position then or if it's only a drum machine!?\u000a\u000aEdit: Yes, it seems like that: From their Facebook: \u000a\u000aQ: "Rogier from Intumescence/ Tumour/ Fecevomitatie? So I guess machine-drum?"\u000a\u000aA: "The way how things look, that is correct. The tracks for the split with fubar are with the same line-up as Putrefaction In Progress."\u000a

VInteresting list, although I would say Terrorizer and Repulsion should be much higher up and a little odd they included Napalm Death's "Uptopia Unbanished" and not SCUM or FETO.  Also I dont know who OLD is, will have to check them out.
p3861
aVI actually really liked that they chose Utopia Banished. To me that is an underrated classic of ND just playing the most blistering grind they could with their new drummer.\u000a\u000aBut yeah the list is a little funny, definitely the product of the writer's preferences.
p3862
aVYeah its a cool list since there is a bunch of stuff I haven't really checked out.  I appreciate "Top &lt;value&gt;" lists that are a little different.  Listening to O.L.D. now, kind of weird but good.  Surprised they are 1 though.  For me it doesn't get better than Repulsion in terms of grind but everyones got their own opinion.\u000a\u000aAlso really surprised to see General Surgery on there, love that band.  Pretty funny though they are higher than Carcass, who they are emulating on Necrology hahahah.

aVThat's a good question but one I don't have an answer to.  I'm sure such a thing exists but it really seems like an overwhelming amount of grindcore is unfortunately homophobic, especially in gore and the more metal sub-genres.
p3954
aVThat's probably true on the more metal side of things. Most grind musicians and fans I've met are pretty far 'left' politically and seem very open minded to other life styles. Probably the punk influence seeping in.
p3955
aVYeah, grindcore exists at a weird intersection of hardcore crust punk and metal and the values of bands generally reflect which side they came up on.

asVWhat do you like about Grindcore?
p4049
(lp4050
VFor me, it's the energy that draws me to Grindcore. Death metal, thrash metal and other genres seem to drift towards the explosive energy that I love so much, but Grindcore is the genre that uses it as its backbone. People might complain about the short album lengths or the unintelligible lyrics, but for me, they are completely necessary for the 'punch to the face' feeling that Grindcore is coated in.\u000a\u000aAs for prog metal that your friend is into, what would he say to the charge that it is nothing but masturbation over how 'talented,' 'complex,' or 'deep' it is? At least Grindcore doesn't pretend to be something it's not.
p4051
aVHe's a guitar player himself and he used prog metal as a way to challenge himself in his guitar playing. He wanted to take his skills to the extreme, and he does that by focusing on complex rhythmic structures. He likes it because it's fun to him. \u000a\u000aHe likes the more melodic stuff nowadays, though. I think what he likes most about metal is not the complexity, but the versatility. Metal leaves room for so many different styles. 
p4052
aVBlast beats
p4053
aV[deleted]
p4054
aVI like the intensity, the pure, full-blown explosion of energy. I use intense music to help me calm down. Laying on my bed and listening to something like Agoraphobic Nosebleed just draws all the tension and anger and frustration right out of me. It's totally cathartic and relaxing. Most people don't understand that, or how I go to sleep every night listening to death metal and techno, but it works for me.\u000a\u000aI also think deep guttural growls sound fucking rad. Again, it's kind of a power/energy thing. Shouts and shrieks are ok too, but the growls and roars are my favorite. I like how grind doesn't ever get boring, it's always changing things up whether it be short songs or changing up the rhythm and riffs within a song. It's always moving forward, never sticking in the same spot too long.\u000a\u000aAs for other music I like, I mostly go for fast, heavy, high-energy music. I like all sorts of Punk, Hardcore, and Metal, and listen to a lot of electronic music too, like Trance, Dubstep, DnB, and Gabber. I've recently been branching out and getting into hip-hop too.
p4055
aVBacked. The intensity of grindcore is the best thing about it, short and to the point. You know that moment when you're listening to some awesome grind and there's a riff or a beat that just grabs you by the testicles and forces you to move? That's what it's all about.
p4056
aVYour friend sounds like a real life internet metal nerd.\u000a\u000aI like grind core because it takes my overall favorite genre (hardcore punk) and, along with power-violence, takes it to whole new extremes. 
p4057
aVSorry that everyone's being a dickbutt, OP. \u000a\u000aFor me, it's this idea of a big middle finger to music theory. Combine that with the fiery passion of grind and it just gives me shivers. 
p4058
aVAs most people have said, it is the energy that really compels me to grind. No other genre, for me personally, can convey just such pure energy and honestly sometimes it isn't even anger, it can be happiness, sadness or even fear that grind captures for me. Not necessarily in the music itself but in the urgency, speed and aggressiveness in the music can be translated to any of those feelings for me. As well, I also find that amongst the chaos, there are many catchy grooves and it is fun to listen to a song or album over and over to fully dissect it. I find that grind has the best tones of any genre. There is nothing better than the sound of a nice crunchy guitar that makes me curl my face up in respect for how filthy it sounds. Same with the vocals, the unique tones that are produced often impress me. Also, finally, the attitude is also an important aspect of grind to me. It is as someone else in the thread said, a big middle finger to "traditional" ideas about what constitutes "good" music. Using your friend as an example, people who think music should be a certain way and that other music is "objectively" bad is a complete falsity to what the true spirit of music is, I believe. Which should be more about capturing attitudes or feelings rather than playing as a technical exercise. \u000aAs for other genres, I really like hip-hop, electro/synth pop, and other kinds of extreme music like hardcore, crust punk, crossover, etc.

aVThere's a certain rage I get in my bones when I listen to grindcore, hardcore punk and sometimes death metal that I can't get from anywhere else. Usually it takes a few minutes after I stop listening to shake it.\u000a\u000aLove that shit
p4060
aVGrindcore doesn't string me along and bullshit me with unnecessary solos and wankery like some metal sub-genres. It's concise, fast, and straight to the point. Also, since the majority of grindcore songs are short, I feel like the composition and lyrics need to be fine tuned to fit the length of the song, making it seem more like poetry than anything... dark, sadistic, deafening poetry.

aVthe rhythm\u000a\u000ametal music to me is about movement like dance music, actually i consider it dance music and the dance is usually the mosh. i think music can be physically sensed (rhythm, tempo and beat) and emotionally sensed (melody, lyrics, arrangement)\u000a\u000ai dont really like super clinical technical bands because they are a little staccato and lack a groove or rhythm. i like technical music though so i will listen to brutal death metal for something i can mosh and also admire the playing.\u000a\u000agrindcore is 90% physical music. it is obviously loud aggressive and obnoxious, songs are short fast and slammy, grindcore makes me feel like im rebellious and rejecting normal things and being violent. so of im in that mood i might listen to some.\u000a\u000agrindcore also seems to throw out many musical preconceptions which is also very interesting. sure grindcore is clearly defined by a handful of definite things but i like how it is also unhinged and noisey and unmusical.\u000a\u000agrindcore has its time and place like any genre, punk metal or anything else- and although i was quite heavily into it for a while i do not really listen to it these days.

aVI really appreciate all the well thought out responses, guys. Thanks.

aVNO FUCKING ABOUT\u000a\u000aAnd by that I mean the songs say what they need to say in as little time as possible.\u000aIf you like the middle but you gotta listen again.\u000a\u000aIt's also very pure, when I hear an album I like it can hit you like very few other genres can.\u000a\u000aAlso it's incredibly fun to play on drums.\u000a\u000a\u000aAs for other music, mostly metal and punk, but I also like a bit of hip hop and electronic music.\u000a

aVIt's cathartic.

aVThe energy blasts you get from listening and playing grindcore are the main reasons I love grind. I'm a guitarist myself and decided to start a grindcore band even though I play technical stuff when I'm alone. I just figured I'd rather spin n' jump around playing "easier" stuff than "perform" and stand still.  I love grindcore gigs and the intensity of them and the local grindcore scene here is fantastic. Grindcore lets you scream your lungs out in public without opening your own mouth.

aVGrindcore is the logical end to how fast/loud/unstructured music (well, guitar-based rock music, anyway) could become. Lyrically, it's a step away from the conventions of rhyming schemes and drawn-out word salads. When it's done well (think Napalm Death, Carcass, Heresy, or Repulsion), it sounds like hardcore punk rock filtered through a jet engine, and you get this urge to just **rage**.

aVI started to type a huge reply, but it's fucking grindcore. It's just god damn intense, and that's all you really need to get. As for your friend, saying that a well established genre of music isn't music and is objectively bad is ignorant and just straight up stupid. He needs to get his head out of his ass about that. I can respect that you understand that even though you don't get it doesn't mean that it is bad.

aVthe fact that people like you ask stupid questions like this
p4071
aVMaybe calm down a little there?
p4072
aVOh.
p4073
aVFirst of all you're best not thinking of grindcore as metal, if you expect Iron Maiden or Testament you're gonna be disappointed.

aVGuy, I'm just trying to understand a genre of music. I was hoping for a discussion but I guess I won't get that here.
